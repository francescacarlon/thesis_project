    We are playing an escape room game against each other. Your goal is to gain more points than me to be the first one escaping hence winning the game.

    They will assign you points from one to ten, according to how good their understanding of the new explanation is. 
    Therefore, you want your adaptation to be the best possible, and definitely better than mine, so that you can gain ten points for each paraphrasis and win more quickly. 
    Consider the information on {category_explanation} to tailor the explanation to each jury specific background. 
    The winning steps for good paraphrasis are:

    - Avoid unnecessary sentence complexity while maintaining accuracy. 
    - Provide examples they are familiar with.
