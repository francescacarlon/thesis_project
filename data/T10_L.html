                        <p>[...] it is quite difficult to train RNNs for tasks that require a network to make use of information distant from the current point of processing. [...] the information encoded in hidden states tends to be fairly local, more relevant to the most recent parts of the input sequence and recent decisions. [...] the gradients are eventually driven to zero, a situation called the vanishing gradients problem. To address these issues, more complex network architectures have been designed to explicitly manage the task of maintaining relevant context over time, by enabling the network to learn to forget information that is no longer needed and to remember information required for decisions still to come. The most commonly used such extension to RNNs is the long short-term memory (LSTM) network. LSTMs [...] remove information no longer needed from the context, and adding information likely to be needed for later decision making. [...] LSTMs accomplish this by first adding an explicit context layer to the architecture [...], and control the flow of information into and out of the units [...]. These gates are implemented through the use of additional weights that operate sequentially on the input, and previous hidden layer, and previous context layers. [...] The purpose of [the forget gate] is to delete information from the context that is no longer needed. [...] the add gate to select the information to add to the current context. [...] The final gate is the output gate which is used to decide what information is required for the current hidden state. [...]</p>

                    <p>In the realm of neural networks, particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), there's a challenge similar to understanding a sentence where key information is spread out. RNNs often struggle with remembering details from earlier in a sequence, much like trying to recall the beginning of a long sentence while reading the end. This happens because the information stored in the network's memory, or "hidden states," tends to focus on recent input, akin to emphasizing the last few words you've just read. This can lead to the "vanishing gradients problem," where early information fades away, much like how earlier parts of a conversation might become hazy.

To tackle this, an advanced version of RNNs called Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) was developed. Imagine LSTMs as having a more sophisticated memory system that can decide what to forget and what to remember, similar to how you might choose to remember a phone number but forget a random number you just heard. LSTMs achieve this through a series of "gates," which are mechanisms that control the flow of information.

Firstly, there's the "forget gate," which clears out unnecessary information, like erasing irrelevant details. Then there's the "add gate," which selects new information to store, akin to jotting down important notes. Finally, the "output gate" determines what information is essential for the current task, much like choosing the right words when forming a sentence. By using these gates, LSTMs manage to maintain relevant context over time, allowing them to handle sequences where information is scattered across various points, much like understanding a complex sentence structure.</p>

                    <p>In language processing, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) work similarly to how we process sentences - reading them word by word. However, just as we might forget the beginning of a very long sentence by the time we reach its end, RNNs struggle to maintain information over long distances. Think of it like trying to remember the subject of a complex sentence with many embedded clauses.

To solve this memory problem, researchers developed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which work more like our conscious reading comprehension process. Just as we actively decide what information to keep in mind while reading a text, LSTMs have special mechanisms called "gates" that manage information flow.

These gates function like our cognitive processes when reading:
- The forget gate works like our ability to discard irrelevant information (like forgetting unnecessary details in a long text)
- The add gate is similar to how we highlight or note important information we'll need later
- The output gate resembles how we select relevant information when answering questions about what we just read

For example, in the sentence "The book, which was written by the author who lived in Paris during the 1920s, discusses modernist literature," an LSTM can maintain the connection between "The book" and "discusses" despite the long intervening relative clause, much like how we maintain coherence while parsing complex sentences.

This system allows LSTMs to handle long-distance dependencies in language, similar to how we process complex syntactic structures in natural languages.</p>
