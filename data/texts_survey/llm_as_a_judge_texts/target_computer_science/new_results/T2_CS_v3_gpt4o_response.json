  "response": "Rankings: 1. CS_c_4_2, 2. CS_g_3_2, 3. CS_o_2  \nBest: CS_c_4_2  \nBest Comment: This text was the most helpful because it effectively used programming analogies to explain linguistic concepts, such as comparing syntactic constituency to nested object composition and CFG to parsing in compilers. The use of specific programming terms and clear analogies made the content highly accessible and relatable for someone with a background in computer science.  \nWorst: CS_o_2  \nWorst Comment: This text was harder to understand due to its more formal and less analogy-driven approach. While technically accurate, it lacked the relatable comparisons to programming concepts that would make it more accessible to a computer scientist."
