CS_o_3\n\nBest: CS_g_1_3  \nBest Comment: This text provided a clear analogy between computer science concepts and linguistic roles, making it accessible and relatable. By comparing linguistic agents and themes to programming elements like functions and data structures, it bridged the gap between familiar CS terminology and new linguistic concepts effectively.\n\nWorst: CS_o_3  \nWorst Comment: While technically accurate, this text was less accessible due to its more abstract and less structured presentation. It lacked the analogy or relatable examples that could have made the concepts easier to grasp, especially for someone with a primarily computer science background."
