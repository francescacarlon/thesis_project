CS_o_3\n\nBest: CS_g_1_3\nBest Comment: The text effectively bridges linguistic concepts with computer science principles, using familiar programming analogies like functions, parameters, and data structures. The explanation of thematic roles through programming concepts (agents as main threads, themes as modified data structures) makes the content immediately relatable for someone with a CS background. The structured progression and clear examples, combined with parallel explanations in both linguistic and CS terms, makes the concepts easily digestible.\n\nWorst: CS_o_3\nWorst Comment: While technically accurate, this text is more challenging to follow due to its dense linguistic terminology and less structured presentation. The lack of clear analogies to computer science concepts makes it harder for a CS professional to grasp the concepts intuitively. Terms like \"volitional causation\" and \"surface realizations\" are not explained in a way that connects to a CS background, making the text less accessible. The format is also more academic and less pedagogical, with fewer clear transitions between concepts."
