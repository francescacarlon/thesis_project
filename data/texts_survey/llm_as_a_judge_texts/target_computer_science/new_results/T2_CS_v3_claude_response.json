CS_o_2\n\nBest: CS_c_4_2\nBest Comment: This text was most effective because it directly mapped linguistic concepts to familiar programming concepts, using precise technical analogies that a CS background would understand. The comparison of parse trees to ASTs, syntactic constituency to object composition, and CFG rules to recursive functions made the concepts immediately accessible. The code-like examples and programming-specific terminology (main(), class definitions, BNF notation) provided concrete anchors for understanding the linguistic concepts.\n\nWorst: CS_o_2\nWorst Comment: This text was the most challenging because it presented the concepts in a traditional academic style without computational analogies. While technically accurate, its abstract explanations of linguistic terms (like \"symbols of the language\" and \"formal language\") weren't grounded in familiar CS concepts. The lack of programming-related examples and the dense theoretical presentation made it harder to connect with existing CS knowledge. The [...] breaks in the text also disrupted the reading flow."
