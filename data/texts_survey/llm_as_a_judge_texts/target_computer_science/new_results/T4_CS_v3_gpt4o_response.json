CS_m_5_4  \nBest: CS_c_4_4  \nBest Comment: This text was helpful because it drew parallels between linguistic concepts and programming concepts, making it easier for someone with a computer science background to understand. By using familiar terms like object instances, classes, and inheritance, the explanation became more relatable and accessible.  \nWorst: CS_m_5_4  \nWorst Comment: This text was harder to understand because it presented the information in a more traditional linguistic format without connecting it to computer science concepts. It lacked the contextual bridge that would make it more accessible to someone with a computer science background."
