CS_o_3  \nBest: CS_g_1_3  \nBest Comment: This text uses programming analogies (e.g., agents as \"main threads,\" INSTRUMENT as \"parameters\") that align with CS knowledge, making abstract linguistic roles intuitive. The comparison of verb alternations to function overloading bridges NLP and CS concepts effectively. Examples are systematic, and explanations emphasize generalization, mirroring CS abstraction principles.  \n\nWorst: CS_o_3  \nWorst Comment: The text relies heavily on linguistic jargon (e.g., \"volitional causation,\" \"surface realizations\") without contextualizing terms for CS readers. While accurate, the lack of explicit analogies to programming or data structures makes it less accessible. The dense, verbose style complicates parsing, especially for non-native English speakers."
