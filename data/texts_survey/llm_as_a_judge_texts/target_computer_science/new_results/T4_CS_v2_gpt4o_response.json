CS_m_5_4  \nBest: CS_c_4_4  \nBest Comment: This text was helpful because it used analogies from object-oriented programming, which are familiar concepts in computer science. By relating word senses and semantic relations to programming constructs, it made the linguistic concepts more accessible and intuitive.  \nWorst: CS_m_5_4  \nWorst Comment: This text was harder to understand as it presented the information in a straightforward, list-like manner without providing context or connections to familiar computer science concepts, which made it less engaging and harder to relate to existing knowledge."
