CS_o_3\n\nBest: CS_g_1_3  \nBest Comment: This text provides a clear and accessible analogy using familiar computer science concepts, such as function calls and data structures. It effectively bridges the gap between computational linguistics and computer science, making the explanation both relatable and engaging. The use of examples and analogies helps solidify the understanding of thematic roles and verb alternations.\n\nWorst: CS_o_3  \nWorst Comment: Although technically accurate, this text is more abstract and less structured compared to the others. It lacks the clear analogies to computer science concepts that would make it more accessible to someone with a computer science background. The presentation feels dense and less engaging, which could make it challenging for readers to follow and fully grasp the concepts."
