  "response": "Rankings: 1. CS_c_4_4, 2. CS_m_5_4, 3. CS_o_4\n\nBest: CS_c_4_4\nBest Comment: The text uses familiar programming concepts like classes, instances, and object-oriented relationships to explain word senses and semantic relationships. The analogies between programming constructs and linguistic concepts (e.g., comparing word senses to class instances, and semantic relationships to inheritance hierarchies) make the content immediately accessible to someone with a computer science background. The structured, technical approach helps bridge the gap between computational thinking and linguistic concepts.\n\nWorst: CS_o_4\nWorst Comment: The text is difficult to follow due to its unstructured format and frequent use of ellipses [...]. While it contains similar information to the other texts, the presentation is fragmented and lacks clear organization. The examples are mixed with definitions in a way that makes it harder to grasp the key concepts. For someone with a technical background, the absence of a clear structural hierarchy or systematic presentation makes it less effective as a learning resource."
