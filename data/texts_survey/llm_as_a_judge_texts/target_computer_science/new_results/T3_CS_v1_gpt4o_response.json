  "response": "Rankings: 1. CS_g_1_3, 2. CS_o_3, 3. CS_m_4_3  \nBest: CS_g_1_3  \nBest Comment: This text effectively uses analogies related to computer science, making the concept of semantic roles intuitive for someone with a CS background. By comparing linguistic roles to programming concepts like function calls and data structures, it provides a familiar framework for understanding. The explanation is clear, relatable, and technically accurate, enhancing comprehension by connecting new linguistic concepts to known CS principles.  \n\nWorst: CS_m_4_3  \nWorst Comment: While technically correct, this text is less engaging and accessible. It lacks the use of analogies or familiar terminology that could help bridge the gap between computer science and linguistics for readers with a CS background. The explanation is straightforward but lacks depth in connecting the concepts to familiar CS ideas, making it harder to grasp for someone not already familiar with linguistic terminology."
