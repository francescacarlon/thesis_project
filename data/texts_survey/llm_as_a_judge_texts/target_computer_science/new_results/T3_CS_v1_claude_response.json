CS_o_3\n\nBest: CS_g_1_3\nBest Comment: The text effectively bridges linguistic concepts with familiar computer science concepts, making it highly accessible for someone with a CS background. The analogies to programming concepts (like main threads, function calls, and data structures) provide clear mental models for understanding thematic roles. The structured progression from basic concepts to more complex alternations, coupled with practical examples, helps build understanding systematically. The comparison of verb alternations to function overloading is particularly helpful for grasping the concept from a CS perspective.\n\nWorst: CS_o_3\nWorst Comment: While technically accurate, this text presents the information in a more abstract and linguistic-heavy manner without connecting to familiar CS concepts. The direct introduction of terms like \"volitional actors\" and \"direct causal responsibility\" without relatable analogies makes it harder to grasp for someone with primarily CS background. The text's structure is also less organized, jumping between concepts without clear transitions, which makes it more challenging to build a coherent mental model of the concepts being presented."
