  "response": "Rankings: 1. CS_c_4_4, 2. CS_m_5_4, 3. CS_o_4  \nBest: CS_c_4_4  \nBest Comment: The programming analogies (OOP concepts like classes, inheritance, composition) directly align with my CS background, making abstract linguistic terms intuitive. Mapping \"word senses\" to object instances and semantic relationships to code hierarchies provided immediate clarity through familiar technical frameworks.  \n\nWorst: CS_o_4  \nWorst Comment: The fragmented structure (e.g., [...] interruptions) and dense prose made it harder to parse key ideas quickly. While accurate, the lack of visual organization (compared to bullet points in CS_m_5_4) and repetitive examples (e.g., \"mouse1/mouse2\" vs. CS_m_5_4â€™s clearer formatting) reduced accessibility for non-native English speakers."
