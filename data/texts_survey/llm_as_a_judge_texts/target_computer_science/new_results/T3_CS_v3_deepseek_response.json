  "response": "Rankings: 1. CS_g_1_3, 2. CS_o_3, 3. CS_m_4_3  \nBest: CS_g_1_3  \nBest Comment: This text effectively bridges linguistic concepts with CS analogies (e.g., agents as \"main threads\" or \"function calls,\" objects as modified data structures). The programming parallels (e.g., function overloading for verb alternations) align with the target audienceâ€™s background, making abstract roles like AGENT and THEME intuitive. Examples are incremental and directly tied to computational thinking, enhancing clarity.  \n\nWorst: CS_m_4_3  \nWorst Comment: The numbered list format disrupts flow, making explanations feel fragmented. While it introduces CS terminology, it underutilizes concrete analogies (e.g., no programming parallels for argument structures). The examples are repetitive and lack depth compared to the other texts, reducing accessibility for readers relying on CS frameworks to grasp linguistic abstractions."
