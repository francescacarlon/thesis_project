  "response": "Rankings: 1. CS_c_4_4, 2. CS_m_5_4, 3. CS_o_4  \nBest: CS_c_4_4  \nBest Comment: The text uses programming metaphors (OOP concepts, type systems) to map linguistic ideas, making abstract semantic relationships instantly relatable for CS practitioners. The analogies (e.g., synonyms as aliases, hyponymy as inheritance) align with familiar technical workflows and reduce cognitive load.  \nWorst: CS_o_4  \nWorst Comment: While accurate, the text relies on dense paragraphs with minimal structure and no CS-specific framing. Terms like \"glosses\" and \"meronymy\" are introduced without analogies, requiring prior linguistic familiarity. The examples are clear but lack explicit ties to computational systems, making it feel abstract for a programming-oriented audience."
