  "response": "Rankings: 1. CS_g_3_2, 2. CS_c_4_2, 3. CS_o_2  \nBest: CS_g_3_2  \nBest Comment: This text uses programming analogies (e.g., CFGs as syntax rules in code, derivations as program execution) that align with a CS background. It breaks down abstract concepts into concrete, relatable examples (e.g., noun phrases as \"modules,\" parse trees as decision trees) and systematically builds from definitions to applications, ensuring technical accuracy without sacrificing clarity.  \nWorst: CS_o_2  \nWorst Comment: The explanation is dense and lacks explicit connections to CS concepts, relying on linguistics-focused terminology (e.g., \"lexicon,\" \"hierarchically embedded\") without analogies. The structure feels academic and less tailored to a programmerâ€™s perspective, making it harder to map linguistic ideas to familiar technical frameworks."
