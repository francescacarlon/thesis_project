CS_o_3\n\nBest: CS_g_1_3  \nBest Comment: CS_g_1_3 was the most helpful because it uses familiar computer science concepts and analogies to explain linguistic roles, making it accessible to someone with a computer science background. The analogy of agents as main threads and themes as data structures provides a relatable framework for understanding the material. This text effectively bridges the gap between computer science and linguistics, presenting complex information in a clear and relatable manner.\n\nWorst: CS_o_3  \nWorst Comment: CS_o_3 was the hardest to understand due to its more abstract presentation of thematic roles without contextual analogies or familiar terms from computer science. While it provides examples, it lacks the direct connection to computer science concepts that would make the content more accessible. The explanation feels dense and assumes a prior understanding of linguistic terminology, which can be challenging for someone primarily trained in computer science."
