CS_o_4  \nBest: CS_c_4_4  \nBest Comment: This text uses programming analogies (e.g., classes, inheritance, composition) to map linguistic concepts directly to familiar CS paradigms like OOP. By framing word senses as \"object instances\" and semantic relationships as code structures (e.g., synonyms = aliases, meronymy = composition), it leverages existing CS intuition. The technical metaphors are consistent, memorable, and reduce abstraction, making semantic hierarchies feel like a type system or codebase organization.  \n\nWorst: CS_o_4  \nWorst Comment: The dense, fragmented structure (e.g., bracketed ellipses, run-on examples like \"mouse1: [...] 1968\") disrupts flow and requires mental parsing. While it covers the same content as CS_m_5_4, it lacks clear visual organization (bullets/headings) and over-relies on raw dictionary-style examples without conceptual framing. The mix of incomplete sentences and jargon-heavy excerpts (\"holonym,\" \"lemmas\") assumes prior linguistic knowledge, making it less accessible to CS practitioners unfamiliar with terminology."
