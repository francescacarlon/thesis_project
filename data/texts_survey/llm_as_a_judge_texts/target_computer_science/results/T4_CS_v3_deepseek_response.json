CS_o_4  \nBest: CS_c_4_4  \nBest Comment: This text was most helpful because it framed linguistic concepts using object-oriented programming metaphors familiar to computer scientists. By comparing word senses to class instantiations, glosses to code documentation, and semantic relationships to inheritance/composition patterns, it created intuitive bridges between linguistics and computational thinking. The structured analogies (e.g., hyponymy as parent-child classes) align with how CS practitioners organize systems, making abstract ideas concrete.  \n\nWorst: CS_o_4  \nWorst Comment: This text was harder to parse due to fragmented formatting (e.g., [...] interruptions) and overly niche examples (e.g., \"1968 computer mouse\"). While accurate, the prose lacked visual structure (no bullet points/sections) and relied on verbose dictionary-style definitions instead of conceptual frameworks. The dense blocks of text mixed technical terms (e.g., \"holonym\") with incomplete contextualization, requiring more cognitive effort to map to computational use cases."
