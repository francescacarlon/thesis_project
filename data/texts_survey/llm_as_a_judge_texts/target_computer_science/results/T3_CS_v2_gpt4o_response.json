CS_o_3\n\nBest: CS_g_1_3  \nBest Comment: CS_g_1_3 effectively uses computer science terminology and analogies to explain linguistic concepts, such as comparing agents in a sentence to main threads or function calls in programming. This analogy makes it easier for someone with a computer science background to grasp the concepts of AGENT, THEME, and INSTRUMENT in sentences. The text also explains verb alternations by relating them to function overloading, which is a familiar concept for computer scientists. The structure and language are clear and accessible, making the information more relatable and easier to understand.\n\nWorst: CS_o_3  \nWorst Comment: CS_o_3, while technically accurate, is less accessible due to its formal linguistic language and lack of relatable analogies for a computer scientist. The use of terms like \"volitional actors\" and \"surface realizations\" without connecting them to computer science concepts makes it harder to follow. Additionally, the text doesn't use programming analogies as effectively as CS_g_1_3, which would have helped bridge the gap between linguistic and computational concepts. Consequently, it feels more like a linguistic explanation than one tailored to a computer science perspective."
