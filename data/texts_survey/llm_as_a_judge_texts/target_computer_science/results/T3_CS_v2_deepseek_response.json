CS_o_3  \nBest: CS_g_1_3  \nBest Comment: This text was the most accessible because it leveraged **programming analogies** (e.g., agents as \"main threads,\" themes as \"data structures modified by functions,\" instruments as \"parameters\") to map linguistic concepts to familiar CS abstractions. The comparison to **function overloading** for verb alternations was particularly effective, as it grounds abstract linguistic theory in concrete programming paradigms. The examples were concise, and the structure mirrored how a programmer might reason about roles and dependencies in code.  \n\nWorst: CS_o_3  \nWorst Comment: While technically accurate, this text was less accessible due to its **overreliance on linguistic terminology** (e.g., \"volitional causation,\" \"prototypically inanimate\") without explicit ties to CS concepts. Terms like \"Breaker of the window-breaking event\" felt verbose and abstract compared to the direct analogies in CS_g_1_3. The dense, paragraph-heavy format also made it harder to parse key ideas quickly, unlike the bullet-pointed examples in CS_m_4_3."
