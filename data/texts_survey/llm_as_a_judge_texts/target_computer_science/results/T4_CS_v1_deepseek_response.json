CS_o_4  \nBest: CS_c_4_4  \nBest Comment: This text directly bridges linguistic concepts to programming paradigms (e.g., word senses as object instances, hyponymy as inheritance hierarchies), leveraging familiar OOP terminology. The analogy to type systems and code structure makes abstract semantic relationships concrete for a CS audience. Examples like \"Mouse\" as a class instantiation and meronymy as composition mirror standard software design patterns, enhancing accessibility.  \n\nWorst: CS_o_4  \nWorst Comment: While comprehensive, the text lacks explicit connections to computational thinking. Terms like \"glosses\" and \"meronymy\" are presented linguistically without analogies to programming abstractions, requiring prior linguistic familiarity. The structure is dense, mixing definitions and examples without visual separation (e.g., bullet points), making it harder to parse for someone accustomed to technical documentation formats."
