CS_o_2  \nBest: CS_c_4_2  \nBest Comment: This text was the most helpful because it directly mapped linguistic concepts to programming equivalents (e.g., syntactic constituency ≈ nested object composition, parse trees ≈ ASTs, CFG rules ≈ BNF syntax). The use of concrete programming metaphors (recursive functions, class inheritance, terminal assignments) and code-like rule definitions made abstract linguistic ideas feel familiar and technically precise. The comparison to compiler processes created immediate relevance for a CS audience.  \n\nWorst: CS_o_2  \nWorst Comment: This text was harder to parse because it presented linguistic theory in isolation, without CS-specific analogies. Terms like \"derivation,\" \"hierarchically embedded,\" and \"formal language\" were explained abstractly rather than through programming lenses. While technically accurate, it required more mental translation for a CS reader (e.g., no mention of ASTs, BNF, or recursion). The lack of code-inspired examples made it feel less actionable compared to the other texts."
