CS_o_3\n\nBest: CS_g_1_3\nBest Comment: This text was most effective because it explicitly drew parallels between linguistic concepts and computer science concepts that I'm familiar with. The comparison of agents to main threads in a program, objects to data structures, and verb alternations to function overloading made the concepts immediately accessible. The structure was also clear, building from simple examples to more complex ones, and the use of programming analogies throughout helped maintain a consistent mental model. The explanation felt like it was specifically written for someone with a CS background.\n\nWorst: CS_o_3\nWorst Comment: This text was the most challenging because it dove directly into linguistic terminology without providing familiar reference points for a CS professional. Terms like \"volitional actors\" and \"surface realizations of predicate arguments\" were introduced without clear context or analogies to computational concepts. The text also had a more dense, academic style that made it harder to parse the key ideas. While it contained all the necessary information, the presentation wasn't optimized for someone with a CS background who might not be familiar with linguistic terminology."
