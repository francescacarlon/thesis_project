CS_o_4\n\nBest: CS_c_4_4  \nBest Comment: This text was particularly helpful because it used analogies from object-oriented programming, which is a familiar concept to computer scientists. By comparing word senses to object instances and semantic relationships to programming concepts like inheritance and composition, the explanation was made clear and accessible. This analogy-based approach bridges the gap between linguistics and programming, making it easier to grasp the different relationships and definitions of word senses.\n\nWorst: CS_o_4  \nWorst Comment: While this text provides detailed information on word senses and their relationships, it was the hardest to understand due to its less structured presentation and lack of familiar analogies. The text jumps between examples and definitions without a clear framework, which might make it challenging for someone from a computer science background to connect the dots. The absence of programming-related analogies means it requires more effort to relate the concepts to familiar ones."
