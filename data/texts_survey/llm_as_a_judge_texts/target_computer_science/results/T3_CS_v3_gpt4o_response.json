CS_o_3\n\nBest: CS_g_1_3  \nBest Comment: This text was the most helpful because it draws clear parallels between computer science concepts and linguistic roles, making it easier for someone with a computer science background to understand. The use of analogies, such as comparing agents to main threads in a program or objects to data structures, provides a relatable framework for comprehending linguistic thematic roles. The text also explains verb alternations in a way that mirrors function overloading in programming, which is a familiar concept to computer scientists. This clarity and relevance in explanation made it stand out.\n\nWorst: CS_o_3  \nWorst Comment: This text was harder to understand because it is less structured and lacks the clear conceptual mappings to computer science terms that are present in the other texts. While it mentions core concepts like AGENT and THEME, it doesn't utilize analogies or explanations that resonate with a computer scientist's typical way of thinking. The text feels more abstract and lacks the practical examples and relatable explanations that facilitate understanding for someone from a computer science background."
