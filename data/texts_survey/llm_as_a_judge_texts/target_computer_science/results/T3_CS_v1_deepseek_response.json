CS_o_3  \nBest: CS_g_1_3  \nBest Comment: This text was the most helpful because it directly mapped linguistic concepts to familiar computer science analogies (e.g., agents as \"main threads,\" themes as \"data structures modified by functions,\" and instrument arguments as \"parameters\"). The programming metaphors (function overloading, parameterized tools) made abstract semantic roles and verb alternations intuitive. The structure mirrored how CS professionals reason about systems, emphasizing modularity and abstraction. Examples were contextualized within programming paradigms, aligning with the target audienceâ€™s background.  \n\nWorst: CS_o_3  \nWorst Comment: This text was harder to follow due to its reliance on linguistics-specific terminology (e.g., \"volitional actors,\" \"surface realizations,\" \"predicate arguments\") without explicit connections to CS concepts. While technically accurate, it assumed prior familiarity with semantic role theory, making it less accessible. The dense prose lacked visual segmentation (like bullet points or numbered steps in CS_m_4_3) and did not leverage analogies to computational processes, which are critical for bridging gaps in interdisciplinary understanding."
