CS_o_2  \nBest: CS_c_4_2  \nBest Comment: This text was the most effective because it directly mapped linguistic concepts to familiar CS constructs (e.g., nested object composition, ASTs, BNF notation) and used programming-specific analogies (recursive functions, compiler parsing). The comparison of noun phrases to custom object classes and CFG rules to recursive functions resonated with a computational mindset. Code snippets (e.g., `NP -> Det Nominal`) and explicit parallels to compilation phases (e.g., AST generation) made the abstraction tangible.  \n\nWorst: CS_o_2  \nWorst Comment: This text was harder to follow because it lacked explicit programming analogies, despite covering the same technical content as CS_g_3_2. Terms like \"derivation\" and \"formal language\" were defined abstractly, without grounding in computational workflows (e.g., call stacks, syntax validation). The terse structure and omission of concrete examples (e.g., how parse trees relate to decision trees) made it feel more like a linguistics primer than a CS-oriented explanation."
