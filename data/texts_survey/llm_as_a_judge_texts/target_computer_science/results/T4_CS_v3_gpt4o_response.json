CS_o_4\n\nBest: CS_c_4_4  \nBest Comment: This text was the most helpful because it effectively uses analogies from programming, a domain familiar to computer scientists, to explain linguistic concepts. By comparing word senses to object instances and semantic relationships to programming structures like inheritance and composition, it bridges the gap between computer science and linguistics. This approach makes the content more accessible and relatable, enhancing understanding through familiar concepts.\n\nWorst: CS_o_4  \nWorst Comment: This text was harder to understand due to its less structured approach and lack of clear analogies. While it contains accurate information, the presentation is more text-heavy and lacks the contextual connections to computer science concepts that could make it more accessible. The explanations feel more like a list rather than an integrated discussion, which can be challenging for someone with a computer science background to follow and retain."
