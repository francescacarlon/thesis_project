CS_o_3\n\nBest: CS_g_1_3\nBest Comment: This text is particularly effective because it explicitly draws parallels between linguistic concepts and computer science concepts, making it highly accessible for someone with a CS background. It uses familiar analogies like \"main thread in a program,\" \"function calls,\" and \"data structures\" to explain linguistic roles. The structure is also well-organized, starting with basic concepts and building up to more complex ideas like verb alternations. The examples are clear and each new concept is connected back to programming concepts, which helps in building a mental model of the linguistic concepts.\n\nWorst: CS_o_3\nWorst Comment: This text is the most challenging because it presents the information in a more traditional linguistic format without making connections to computer science concepts. The dense presentation of terms like \"volitional causation\" and \"surface realizations of predicate arguments\" without proper context or familiar analogies makes it harder to grasp for someone with a CS background. While the information is technically accurate, the lack of structure and CS-relevant analogies makes it less accessible. The text also jumps between concepts without clear transitions, making it harder to follow the logical progression of ideas."
