L_o_10  \nBest: L_c_5_10  \nBest Comment: This text was the most helpful because it directly bridges linguistic concepts (e.g., discourse structure, pronoun resolution, working memory limitations) with LSTM mechanisms. The analogy between cognitive processes (e.g., maintaining referents, using discourse markers) and technical components (e.g., gates, context layers) makes abstract ML concepts tangible for a linguist. The bullet-point structure and familiar terminology (e.g., \"mental discourse model\") align perfectly with linguistic training, avoiding technical jargon while maintaining accuracy.  \n\nWorst: L_o_10  \nWorst Comment: This text was harder to understand due to its reliance on ML-specific terminology (e.g., \"gradients,\" \"hidden states,\" \"additional weights\") without sufficient analogical grounding. While technically accurate, it assumes familiarity with neural network architecture and training challenges (e.g., vanishing gradients), which are outside a linguistâ€™s typical expertise. The lack of explicit connections to linguistic theory or relatable metaphors makes it less accessible despite its thorough explanation."
