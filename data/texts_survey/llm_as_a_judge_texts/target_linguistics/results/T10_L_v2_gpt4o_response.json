L_o_10\n\nBest: L_g_2_10  \nBest Comment: This text was the most helpful because it used accessible language and relatable analogies that connected the technical concepts of neural networks with familiar cognitive processes. The comparison of LSTM gates to mental notes and processes like forgetting and highlighting information made the technical details more tangible and easier to grasp. This text provided a clear, step-by-step explanation that aligned well with how linguists think about language processing, making the content more relatable and easier to understand.\n\nWorst: L_o_10  \nWorst Comment: This text was the hardest to understand because it was more technical and dense, with less emphasis on providing relatable analogies or linguistic parallels. The explanations of LSTM mechanisms were more abstract and focused on the architecture and implementation details, which could be challenging for someone without a strong background in programming or machine learning. The lack of clear, cognitive analogies made it less accessible and harder to connect with the linguistic perspective."
