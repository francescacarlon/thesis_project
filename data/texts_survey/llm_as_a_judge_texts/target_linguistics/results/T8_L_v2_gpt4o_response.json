L_o_8\n\nBest: L_g_3_8  \nBest Comment: This text was the most helpful because it draws parallels between the computational concepts and linguistic concepts, which makes it more accessible for someone with a linguistics background. The analogy of understanding how changes in parts of a sentence affect the overall meaning helps in grasping the chain rule and backward differentiation conceptually. The language used is clear and the explanations are broken down into familiar concepts, which aids comprehension.\n\nWorst: L_o_8  \nWorst Comment: This text was the hardest to understand because it lacks the contextual analogies that make the concept relatable to a linguist. The language is more technical and assumes a level of familiarity with computational terminology that might not be present for someone not versed in this area. The explanations are straightforward but not as accessible due to the absence of relatable examples or analogies."
