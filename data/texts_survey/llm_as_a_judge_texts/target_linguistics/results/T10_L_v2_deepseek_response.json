L_o_10  \nBest: L_c_5_10  \nBest Comment: This text was most helpful because it directly connects LSTM mechanisms to linguistic concepts familiar to linguists, such as discourse structure, pronoun resolution, and mental discourse models. The analogies (e.g., forget gate ≈ clearing old referents, add gate ≈ introducing new discourse topics) leverage existing knowledge of language processing, making abstract technical ideas feel intuitive. The focus on cognitive processes mirrors how linguists analyze language, aligning with their expertise in tracking grammatical dependencies and coherence.  \n\nWorst: L_o_10  \nWorst Comment: This text was harder to understand due to its dense technical language (e.g., \"additional weights,\" \"hidden states,\" \"gradients\") and lack of linguistic or cognitive analogies. While accurate, it assumes familiarity with machine learning architecture details and focuses on abstract mechanisms (e.g., \"explicit context layer\") without grounding them in relatable concepts. The minimal use of narrative structure or comparisons to language processing makes it less accessible to those without computational training."
