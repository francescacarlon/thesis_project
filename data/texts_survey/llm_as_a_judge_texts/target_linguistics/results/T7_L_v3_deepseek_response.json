L_o_7  \nBest: L_d_3_7  \nBest Comment: This text was most effective because it leveraged linguistic analogies familiar to a linguist (e.g., phonetic transcription, syntax trees, articulatory steps) to explain abstract machine learning concepts. The parallels between gradient descent and tuning a synthesizer, or backpropagation and error diagnosis in syntax trees, created intuitive bridges between linguistic knowledge and technical processes. The structure (three explicit \"linguistic parallels\") and metaphorical language (\"mental rules,\" \"systematic feedback\") made the explanation both cohesive and accessible.  \n\nWorst: L_o_7  \nWorst Comment: This text was less accessible due to its dense technical phrasing (e.g., \"partial derivative of the loss function with respect to each parameter\") and lack of explanatory analogies. While accurate, it assumed familiarity with optimization algorithms and calculus, which a linguist might lack. The explanation of backpropagation as \"backward differentiation\" was abstract and failed to ground the concept in relatable terms. The absence of explicit structure or examples made it harder to parse compared to the other texts."
