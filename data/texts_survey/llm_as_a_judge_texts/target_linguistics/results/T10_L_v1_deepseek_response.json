L_o_10  \nBest: L_c_5_10  \nBest Comment: This text was most helpful because it directly bridges linguistic concepts (e.g., pronoun resolution, discourse models, topic continuity) with LSTM mechanisms, mirroring how linguists analyze language structure. The analogy between cognitive processes (working memory limitations, mental discourse tracking) and technical components (gates, context layers) makes abstract ML concepts feel familiar. By framing \"forget/add/output gates\" as linguistic phenomena (e.g., referent management, discourse topic introduction), it leverages a linguistâ€™s existing analytical toolkit for clarity.  \n\nWorst: L_o_10  \nWorst Comment: This text was least accessible due to its technical density and lack of conceptual bridging. Terms like \"gradients,\" \"hidden states,\" and \"weights\" assume ML-specific knowledge, while explanations of gates focus on architectural implementation (e.g., \"additional weights that operate sequentially\") rather than functional purpose. The absence of linguistic parallels or relatable metaphors makes it read like a technical manual rather than an explanatory resource for language-focused scholars."
