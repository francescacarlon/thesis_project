L_o_10  \nBest: L_g_2_10  \nBest Comment: This text provides a clear analogy between human memory processes and LSTM functionality, making complex concepts accessible. The use of relatable examples such as reading a sentence and the mental note analogy enhances understanding, especially for someone with a linguistic background.  \nWorst: L_o_10  \nWorst Comment: Although technically accurate, this text uses more technical jargon and lacks analogies that would help bridge the gap between complex concepts and a linguistâ€™s understanding. The detailed description of gates and weights without contextual analogies makes it less accessible."
