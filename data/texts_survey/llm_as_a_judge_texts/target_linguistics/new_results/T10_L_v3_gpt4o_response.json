  "response": "Rankings: 1. L_c_5_10, 2. L_g_2_10, 3. L_o_10  \nBest: L_c_5_10  \nBest Comment: This text effectively uses linguistic analogies to explain LSTMs, drawing clear parallels between linguistic processes and neural network functions. The references to discourse markers and cognitive mechanisms make it relatable and easier to understand for someone with a background in linguistics.  \nWorst: L_o_10  \nWorst Comment: This text is more technical and lacks the linguistic analogies present in the other texts. The focus on technical terminology and less accessible explanations makes it harder to grasp for someone without a strong computer science background."
