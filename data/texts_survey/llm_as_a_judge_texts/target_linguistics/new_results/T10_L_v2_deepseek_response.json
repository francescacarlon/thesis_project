  "response": "Rankings: 1. L_c_5_10, 2. L_g_2_10, 3. L_o_10  \nBest: L_c_5_10  \nBest Comment: This text directly aligns with linguistic expertise by framing LSTM mechanisms through discourse processing (e.g., pronoun resolution, topic continuity) and cognitive models familiar to linguists. The analogy between gates and linguistic devices (e.g., discourse markers, referent tracking) bridges technical concepts with prior knowledge, making abstract ideas tangible.  \n\nWorst: L_o_10  \nWorst Comment: The dense technical jargon (e.g., \"gradients,\" \"hidden states,\" \"weights\") and lack of explanatory analogies make this text inaccessible. It assumes familiarity with neural network architecture details, which a linguist without CS training might lack. The fragmented structure and minimal contextualization hinder comprehension."
