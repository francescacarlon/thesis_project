L_o_10  \nBest: L_g_2_10  \nBest Comment: This text was helpful because it used clear analogies that resonate well with someone who has a background in linguistics but is still learning about computational concepts. The comparison of LSTMs to mental notes and discourse management made the technical aspects more relatable and easier to grasp.  \n\nWorst: L_o_10  \nWorst Comment: The text was hard to understand due to its dense and technical language. It lacked the illustrative examples and analogies present in the other texts, making it less accessible to someone from a linguistics background with limited experience in computer science concepts."
