By comparing the process to teaching phonetics and using everyday linguistic tasks as metaphors, it made complex ideas more relatable and easier to grasp for someone with a linguistic background.  \n\nWorst: L_o_7  \nWorst Comment: Although technically accurate, this text was less engaging and somewhat dense. It lacked the analogies that could bridge the gap between computational concepts and linguistic understanding, making it harder to follow for someone not deeply versed in computer science."
