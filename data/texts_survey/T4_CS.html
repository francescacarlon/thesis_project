                        <p>A sense (or word sense) is a discrete representation of one aspect of the meaning of a word. [...] In context, it's easy to see the different meanings: mouse1: a mouse controlling a computer system in 1968. mouse2: a quiet animal like a mouse. bank1: a bank can hold the investments in a custodial account. bank2: as agriculture burgeons on the east bank, the river...[...] we need to consider the alternative ways that dictionaries and thesauruses offer for defining senses. One is based on the fact that dictionaries or thesauruses give textual definitions for each sense called glosses. [...] bank: 1. financial institution that accepts deposits and channels the money into lending activities 2. sloping land (especially the slope beside a body of water). [...] when two senses of two different words (lemmas) are identical, or nearly identical, we say the two senses are synonyms [...] couch/sofa vomit/throw up filbert/hazelnut car/automobile. [...] antonyms are words with an opposite meaning, like: long/short big/little fast/slow cold/hot dark/light. [...] [a] hyponym of [a] word if the [other word] is more specific, denoting a subclass of the other. For example, car is a hyponym of vehicle, dog is a hyponym of animal, [...]. Conversely, we say that vehicle is a hypernym of car, and animal is a hypernym of dog. [...] meronymy, the part-whole relation. [...] wheel is a meronym of car, and car is a holonym of wheel.</p>

                    <p>Here's my adapted explanation for CS practitioners:

Think of word senses like different object instances of the same class name in programming. Just as "Mouse" could be instantiated as either a ComputerPeripheral or a Mammal class, words can have multiple distinct implementations of meaning.

Dictionary definitions (glosses) work like documentation strings or comments in code, explaining the specific implementation of each sense. For example, "bank" could be instantiated as either a FinancialInstitution or a GeographicalFeature class.

The relationships between words mirror object-oriented programming concepts:
- Synonyms are like aliases or multiple references pointing to the same object implementation (car/automobile)
- Antonyms are like boolean opposites (hot/cold)
- Hyponymy/hypernymy reflects inheritance hierarchies: Vehicle is the parent class, while Car is a child class inheriting from Vehicle
- Meronymy represents composition relationships, similar to how a Car class contains Wheel objects as component parts

Just as we use type systems to organize code, these semantic relationships create a structured hierarchy for organizing word meanings in computational systems.</p>

                    <p>1. Word Senses:
       - A word sense is a separate definition of a word's meaning in a specific context. For instance, the word 'bank' can refer to a financial institution (bank1), or the sloping land beside a body of water (bank2).

    2. Defining Word Senses:
       - Dictionaries and thesauruses provide definitions, known as glosses, for each distinct sense.

    3. Synonyms:
       - Synonyms are words with identical or nearly identical meanings, such as couch and sofa, filbert and hazelnut, or car and automobile.

    4. Antonyms:
       - Antonyms are words with opposite meanings, like big and small, fast and slow, hot and cold, light and dark.

    5. Hyponymy:
       - A hyponym is a word that is more specific and denotes a subclass of another word. For example, car is a hyponym of vehicle, and dog is a hyponym of animal.

    6. Hypernymy:
       - The opposite of hyponymy, a hypernym is a more general word that encompasses a specific word. For instance, vehicle is a hypernym of car, and animal is a hypernym of dog.

    7. Meronymy:
       - Meronymy refers to the part-whole relationship, such as wheel being a part (meronym) of a car, and a car being the whole (holonym) that contains the wheel.</p>
