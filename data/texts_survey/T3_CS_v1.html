                        <p>Consider the meanings of the arguments Sasha, Pat, the window, and the door in these two sentences. Sasha broke the window. Pat opened the door. The subjects Sasha and Pat, what we might call the breaker of the window breaking event and the opener of the door-opening event, have something in common. They are both volitional actors, often animate, and they have direct causal responsibility for their events. Thematic roles are a way to capture this semantic commonality between breakers and openers. We say that the subjects of both these verbs are agents. Thus, AGENT is the thematic role that represents an abstract idea such as volitional causation. Similarly, the direct objects of both these verbs, the BrokenThing and OpenedThing, are both prototypically inanimate objects that are affected in some way by the action. The semantic role for these participants is theme. [...] Semantic roles thus help generalize over different surface realizations of predicate arguments. For example, while the AGENT is often realized as the subject of the sentence, in other cases the THEME can be the subject. [...] John (AGENT) broke the window (THEME). John (AGENT) broke the window (THEME) with a rock (INSTRUMENT). The rock (INSTRUMENT) broke the window (THEME). The window (THEME) broke. The window (THEME) was broken by John (AGENT). These examples suggest that break has (at least) the possible arguments AGENT, THEME, and INSTRUMENT. [...] These multiple argument structure realizations [...] are called verb alternations or diathesis alternations.</p>

                        <p>1. Distinguish the functions of Sasha, Pat, window, and door in these statements: Sasha shattered the window, Pat opened the door. Sasha and Pat, the instigators of the window-shattering and door-opening incidents, share a commonality. They are active agents who have direct control over their actions. In CS, we label these subjects as agents. The thematic role term for this concept is AGENT. On the other hand, the window and door are passive entities that are subject to change due to the actions of these agents. The semantic role for them is theme.

    2. For example, in the sentences "John shattered the window" and "John shattered the window with a hammer", the AGENT is John, while the THEME is the broken window, and the hammer acts as the INSTRUMENT in the second sentence. In "The window shattered", the window is still the theme, but without an explicit agent. In "The window was shattered by John", the agent is John, and the window remains the theme. These examples demonstrate that the verb "shatter" can take the arguments AGENT, THEME, and INSTRUMENT.

    3. These diverse argument structures, such as those illustrated in the examples, are known as verb alternations or diathesis alternations. They provide a means to generalize over various forms of predicate arguments. For instance, while the AGENT is often the subject of the sentence, in some cases, the THEME can take on this role.

    By using familiar CS terminology and providing examples that the jury can relate to, the explanation becomes more understandable and accurate.</p>

                        <p>In computer science, we often deal with structured representations of data and the relationships between different entities. When analyzing language, we can think of sentences as structured data, where each part has a specific role. Let's break down the concepts using this analogy.

Consider these sentences: "Sasha broke the window" and "Pat opened the door." Here, Sasha and Pat are the subjects. In our CS terms, think of them as the main actors or agents in these events. An agent, in linguistic terms, is like the main thread in a program that initiates an action. Sasha and Pat are the ones causing something to happen, just like a function call might initiate a process.

The window and the door are the objects affected by these actions. In programming, you might think of these as the data structures that are modified by a function. These objects have a thematic role called THEME, which represents the items being acted upon.

Now, let's discuss the flexibility of these roles. In different contexts, the same verb can involve various arguments. For example, in "John broke the window with a rock," John is the AGENT, the window is the THEME, and the rock is the INSTRUMENT. Here, the rock is like a tool or parameter used by the function (John) to achieve an effect (breaking the window).

Sometimes, the structure changes, but the roles can be understood by the effect they have on the sentence's meaning. For instance:
- "The rock (INSTRUMENT) broke the window (THEME)." 
- "The window (THEME) broke."
- "The window (THEME) was broken by John (AGENT)."

These examples show that the same verb "break" can have different argument structures, known as verb alternations or diathesis alternations. This is similar to how a function might be overloaded to handle different types or numbers of parameters in programming.

Understanding these roles and alternations helps us abstract the core semantics of sentences, similar to how we abstract data types and functions in computer science to handle various situations effectively.</p>
