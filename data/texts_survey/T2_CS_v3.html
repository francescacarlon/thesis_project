                        <p>Here's my adaptation for CS practitioners:

In programming languages, syntactic constituency is like nested object composition, where smaller components combine to form larger functional units. Think of it as a tree data structure where each node represents a language component.

Context-Free Grammar (CFG) is similar to the compilation process's parsing phase, where code is broken down into a hierarchical structure. Just as programming languages have syntax rules (like how to form a valid if-statement or function declaration), natural language has production rules that define valid word combinations.

Consider this analogy: A noun phrase is like a custom object class, where different instances (three parties from Brooklyn, the big computer, my red car) can all serve as the subject in a statement, just as different objects of the same class can be used interchangeably in your code.

The CFG rules work like a recursive function: starting from a root node (like the main() function), it expands into smaller components following predefined patterns. For example:NP -> Det Nominal  // Parent class definition
Det -> "the"       // Terminal value assignment
Nominal -> "computer" // Terminal value assignmentThe parse tree generated is essentially an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), similar to what compilers create when parsing source code. Valid sentences are those that can be generated by following these grammar rules, just as valid programs must follow the programming language's syntax rules.

Think of generative grammar as the BNF (Backus-Naur Form) notation used to define programming language syntax, but for natural language instead.</p>

                        <p>Syntactic constituency is the idea that groups of words can behave as single units, or constituents. Consider the noun phrase, a sequence of words surrounding at least one noun. [...] they can all appear in similar syntactic environments, for example, before a verb: 'three parties from Brooklyn arrive'. [...] A widely used formal system for modeling constituent structure in natural language is the context-free grammar (CFG). [...] A context-free grammar consists of a set of rules or productions, each of which expresses the ways that symbols of the language can be grouped and ordered together, and a lexicon of words and symbols. [...] an NP (or noun phrase) can be composed of either a ProperNoun or a determiner (Det) followed by a Nominal; [...]. Context-free rules can be hierarchically  embedded, [...]: Det → a, Det → the, Noun → flight. [...] Thus, a CFG can be used to generate a set of strings. This sequence of rule expansions is called a derivation of the string of words. It is common to represent a derivation by a parse tree (commonly shown inverted with the root at the top). [...]. A CFG like that of L0 defines a formal language. Sentences (strings of words) that can be derived by a grammar are in the formal language defined by that grammar, and are called grammatical sentences. Sentences that cannot be derived by a given formal grammar are not in the language defined by that grammar and are  referred to as ungrammatical. [...] In linguistics, the use of formal languages to model natural languages is called generative grammar [...].</p>

                        <p>In computer science terms, syntactic constituency is like treating certain groups of words as single "modules" or "units" in a program. Take a noun phrase, for example: it’s a sequence of words that includes at least one noun. These noun phrases can be used in similar positions in a sentence, much like how functions can be called in similar contexts within different parts of your code. For instance, in the sentence "three parties from Brooklyn arrive," the noun phrase "three parties from Brooklyn" acts as a single unit that appears before the verb "arrive."

To formally model how these word groups work, we use something similar to what you might recognize as context-free grammars (CFGs) in programming languages. A CFG is a set of rules that describe how words and symbols can be combined, much like syntax rules in a programming language. For example, a noun phrase (NP) might be made up of a ProperNoun or a determiner (Det) followed by a Nominal. These rules can be layered, similar to how functions can call other functions: Det → a, Det → the, Noun → flight.

Using these rules, a CFG can generate sequences of words, known as a derivation. Think of it like tracing the execution of a program through a call stack. This derivation can be visualized using a parse tree, where the tree's root is at the top and branches show how the sentence is built, much like a decision tree in algorithms.

A CFG defines a formal language, where sentences that can be "derived" or generated by the grammar are considered "grammatical," like valid inputs that your code can process. Sentences that can't be derived are "ungrammatical," similar to invalid inputs that would cause your program to throw an error.

In the field of linguistics, using formal languages to model natural language structures is called generative grammar, akin to how we use formal languages to define the syntax rules in programming languages.</p>
