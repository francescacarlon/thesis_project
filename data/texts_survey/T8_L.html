                        <p>The importance of the computation graph comes from the backward pass, which is used to compute the derivatives that we'll need for the weight update. [...] Backwards differentiation makes use of the chain rule [...]. Suppose we are computing the derivative of a composite function f(x) = u(v(x)). The derivative of f(x) is the derivative of u(x) with respect to v(x) times the derivative of v(x) with respect to x. [...] The chain rule extends to more than two functions. If computing the derivative of a composite function f(x) = u(v(w(x))), the derivative of f(x) is: df/dx = du/dv·dv/dw·dw/dx. The intuition of backward differentiation is to pass gradients back from the final node to all the nodes in the graph. [...] Each node takes an upstream gradient that is passed in from its parent node to the right, and for each of its inputs computes a local gradient (the gradient of its output with respect to its input), and uses the chain rule to multiply these two to compute a downstream gradient to be passed on to the next earlier node. Let's now compute the 3 derivatives we need. Since in the computation graph L = ce, we can directly compute the derivative ∂L/∂c: ∂L/∂c = e. For the other two, we'll need to use the chain rule: ∂L/∂a=∂L/∂e*∂e/∂a [and] ∂L/∂b=∂L/∂e*∂e/∂d*∂d/∂b.</p>

                    <p>1. The computation graph in machine learning is crucial for its backward pass, which calculates the needed derivatives for updating the weights during the learning process. The principal tool used in this process is chain rule from calculus.

    2. Let's imagine a complex function f(x) that is the result of multiple operations u(v(x)). To calculate the derivative of this function, we use the chain rule. Specifically, the derivative of f(x) is the derivative of u(x) with respect to v(x) times the derivative of v(x) with respect to x.

    3. Consider a simple example of the chain rule applied to a composite function f(x) = u(v(w(x))). The derivative of f(x) can be calculated as follows: df/dx = du/dv·dv/dw·dw/dx.

    4. The chain rule's fundamental principle is that it allows us to "pass" the gradients from the final node backward through the entire graph. Each node in the graph receives an upstream gradient from its parent node, computes local gradients (gradients of the output with respect to its input), and then passes downstream gradients to the next earlier node using the chain rule.

    5. Let's calculate the derivatives we need for our example. Suppose our computation graph is L = ce, the derivative of L with respect to c is straightforward: ∂L/∂c = e. To find the derivatives with respect to a and b, we'll use the chain rule: ∂L/∂a = ∂L/∂e * ∂e/∂a and ∂L/∂b = ∂L/∂e * ∂e/∂d * ∂d/∂b.</p>

                    <p>In the world of computation, we often deal with functions that depend on other functions, much like how words in a sentence depend on each other for meaning. Here, we're focusing on something called a "computation graph," which is crucial for a process called "backward differentiation." This process helps us figure out how to adjust the 'weights' in a system, similar to editing a sentence to improve its clarity or meaning.

Let’s break down the key idea using concepts you're familiar with. Backward differentiation uses a mathematical principle called the chain rule, which you can think of as understanding how changes in one part of a sentence affect the whole sentence's meaning. Imagine you have a function f(x) that is made up of two smaller functions, u and v, like a sentence made up of phrases. The overall change in f(x) is influenced by changes in both u and v, just as changing one phrase affects the entire sentence.

The chain rule tells us that to find the change in f(x), we multiply the change in u with respect to v by the change in v with respect to x. This concept extends to more complex functions, like adding more phrases to a sentence. For example, if f(x) is made up of three functions u(v(w(x))), the change in f(x) involves multiplying the changes across all functions, much like understanding how each phrase in a compound sentence contributes to the overall message.

In backward differentiation, we trace these changes back through the computation graph, starting from the end and moving to the beginning, similar to proofreading a sentence backwards to see how each word contributes to the sentence's meaning.

Now, let's see this in action with an example. Suppose in our computation graph, we have L = ce. Here, the derivative (or change) of L with respect to c is simply e, much like how changing a single word affects its immediate meaning. For changes involving more parts, like ∂L/∂a, we apply the chain rule: ∂L/∂a=∂L/∂e*∂e/∂a. Similarly, for ∂L/∂b, the chain rule helps us: ∂L/∂b=∂L/∂e*∂e/∂d*∂d/∂b.

By understanding how each part of the function affects the whole, we can adjust the 'weights' effectively, much as you would revise a complex sentence to ensure every word is contributing to your intended meaning.</p>
