                        <p>In the context of Computational Linguistics, we transcribe words using a sequence of phonetic symbols derived from the Roman alphabet, representing speech sounds called phones. The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is the standard for transcribing languages worldwide. In English, the mapping between the spelling and phonetic symbols is not straightforward; a single letter can represent multiple sounds depending on the context. On the other hand, languages like Spanish have a clearer sound-spelling correspondence. Articulatory Phonetics focuses on the production of these phones by the various organs in the mouth, throat, and nose that modify the airflow from the lungs. We classify consonants based on their point of maximum restriction and place of articulation, such as bilabial [p,b,m], labiodental [v,f], dental [th,dh], alveolar [s,z,t,d], and velar [k,g]. Consonants can also be categorized by the manner of articulation, such as voiced stops [b,d,g], unvoiced stops [p,t,k], nasal sounds [n,m,ng], labiodental fricatives [f,v], alveolar fricatives [s,z], affricates [ch,jh], and approximants [y,w].</p>

                        <p>To better understand how words are pronounced, we'll break down their spoken sounds, or phones, into strings of symbols. Think of it like tokenizing text in NLP, where we divide words into individual units, or tokens. In phonetics, these symbols are adapted from the Roman alphabet and follow the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) standard. This is similar to how we use standardized annotation schemes in corpus linguistics to ensure consistency in our analyses. 

    Now, when we map English orthography to phones, the relationship isn't always straightforward. This is because a single letter can represent different sounds depending on the context, much like how a word's part-of-speech tag can change based on its syntactic context. For instance, the letter "c" can be pronounced as /k/ in "cat" but as /s/ in "circle". In contrast, languages like Spanish have a more transparent sound-orthography mapping, making it easier to predict pronunciation from spelling.

    Articulatory phonetics, a subfield of phonetics, examines how phones are produced by modifying airflow from the lungs using various organs in the mouth, throat, and nose. This process can be likened to the way we use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to model the probability of a sequence of observations, where the observations are the sounds produced. 

    We can categorize consonants based on their point of maximum restriction, or place of articulation. For example, bilabial consonants like /p/, /b/, and /m/ are produced by obstructing airflow with both lips. Similarly, labiodental consonants like /v/ and /f/ involve the lower lip and upper teeth. Dental consonants, such as the /th/ in "thing" and the /dh/ in "though", are produced by placing the tongue between the teeth. Alveolar consonants, like /s/, /z/, /t/, and /d/, involve the tongue and the alveolar ridge. Velar consonants, including /k/ and /g/, are produced by the back of the tongue and the soft palate.

    Consonants can also be distinguished by the manner of articulation, which refers to how the airflow is restricted. This is analogous to the way we classify words based on their syntactic properties, such as part-of-speech tags. For instance, voiced stops like /b/, /d/, and /g/ involve the vibration of the vocal cords, whereas unvoiced stops like /p/, /t/, and /k/ do not. Nasal sounds like /n/, /m/, and /ng/ are produced by allowing airflow through the nose. Labiodental fricatives like /f/ and /v/ involve the lower lip and upper teeth, while alveolar fricatives like /s/ and /z/ are produced by the tongue and the alveolar ridge. Affricates like /ch/ and /jh/ combine a stop and a fricative, and approximants like /y/ and /w/ involve the tongue approaching the roof of the mouth without blocking the airflow. 

    By understanding how phones are produced and categorized, we can better analyze and model language, much like how we use large language models (LLMs) to generate and understand human-like language. This knowledge can also inform the development of speech recognition systems and other NLP applications, ultimately enhancing our ability to interact with and understand spoken language.</p>

In computational linguistics, we often represent the pronunciation of words using a sequence of phones, which are distinct speech sounds. These phones are denoted by symbols similar to the Roman alphabet. To standardize this across different languages, we use the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), which provides a consistent way to transcribe sounds globally. Unlike English, where a single letter can represent different sounds depending on the context, languages like Spanish exhibit a more straightforward relationship between written letters and spoken sounds.

Articulatory phonetics, a subfield often intersecting with NLP tasks like speech recognition, examines how speech sounds are produced by manipulating airflow through various organs in the mouth, throat, and nose. For instance, consonants can be categorized based on where the airflow is most restricted, known as the place of articulation. Examples include bilabial sounds like [p], [b], and [m], which involve both lips, and alveolar sounds like [s], [z], [t], and [d], where the tongue touches the alveolar ridge.

Furthermore, consonants are characterized by the manner of articulation, or how airflow is restricted. This includes voiced stops like [b], [d], and [g], where the vocal cords vibrate, and unvoiced stops like [p], [t], and [k], where they do not. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for developing accurate speech synthesis and recognition systems, which rely on detailed phonetic transcription to convert text to speech and vice versa.</p>

                        <p>In computational linguistics, we handle word pronunciation by converting sounds into machine-readable symbols, similar to how we tokenize text. Think of it as creating a phonetic encoding system, where each sound unit (phone) is represented by a standardized symbol from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).

Just as programming languages need consistent syntax, languages vary in how consistently their written form maps to pronunciation. English is like a complex regex pattern with many exceptions - the same letter can produce different sounds in different contexts. Spanish, conversely, is more like a straightforward one-to-one mapping function.

The physical production of these sounds follows a systematic classification, analogous to how we categorize tokens in NLP. Instead of part-of-speech tags, we categorize sounds based on two main features:

1. Place of articulation (location where airflow is modified):
   - Bilabial (using both lips): [p], [b], [m]
   - Labiodental (lip-to-teeth): [v], [f]
   - Dental (tongue-to-teeth): [th] as in "thing", [dh] as in "though"
   - Alveolar (tongue-to-ridge): [s], [z], [t], [d]
   - Velar (back of mouth): [k], [g]

2. Manner of articulation (how airflow is modified):
   - Stops (complete blockage): voiced [b,d,g], unvoiced [p,t,k]
   - Nasals (through nose): [n,m,ng]
   - Fricatives (continuous friction): labiodental [f,v], alveolar [s,z]
   - Affricates (stop+friction): [ch,jh]
   - Approximants (minimal obstruction): [y,w]

This structured classification system is comparable to how we organize linguistic features in computational models.</p>

                        <p>In computational terms, phones function as atomic phonetic tokens mapped via IPA—a Unicode-like standardization system for cross-lingual speech sound representation. Orthography-to-phone alignment varies in predictability: English resembles irregular grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (e.g., "ough" in *though* vs. *through*), while Spanish aligns with rule-based tokenization. Articulatory phonetics analyzes speech sound generation as biomechanical feature engineering: **place** (articulator positions: bilabial [p], alveolar [t]) and **manner** (airflow modulation: fricatives [s], stops [k]) act as phonetic feature sets. These classes parallel acoustic model training data, where voicing (vibrational [z] vs. non-vibrational [s]) or nasality ([m]) serve as discriminative features for speech recognition systems. For NLP, this relates to TTS pipelines converting spelling to pronunciation using context-sensitive rules—akin to disambiguating homographs via syntactic context.</p>
