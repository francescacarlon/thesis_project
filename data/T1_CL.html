                        <p>Parts of speech fall into two broad categories: closed class and open class. Closed classes are those with relatively fixed membership, such as prepositions [...]. By contrast, nouns and verbs are open classes [...]. Closed class words are generally function words like of, it, and, or you, which tend to be very short, occur frequently, and often have structuring uses in grammar. Four major open classes occur in the languages of the world: nouns [...], verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, [...]. Nouns are words for people, places, or things,  [...]. Verbs refer to actions and processes, including main verbs like draw, provide, and go. English verbs have inflections (non-third-person-singular (eat), third-person singular (eats), progressive (eating), past participle (eaten)). [...]. Adjectives often describe properties or qualities of nouns, like color (white, black), age (old, young), and value (good, bad), [...]. Adverbs generally modify something. [...] A particle [...] is used in combination with a verb. Particles often have extended meanings that aren't quite the same as the prepositions they resemble, as in the particle 'over' in 'she turned the paper over'. A phrasal verb and a particle acting as a single unit is called a phrasal verb. The meaning of phrasal verbs is often non-compositional - not predictable from the individual meanings of the verb and the particle. [...]</p>

                        <p>For the computational linguistics practitioner, the classification of words into two main categories - closed and open classes - is crucial. Closed classes are characterized by a relatively fixed membership, such as prepositions (e.g., in, on, with), which contrast with open classes like nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Closed class words, often function words, have structuring uses in grammar, are typically short, and occur frequently (e.g., you, and, or). The four primary open classes found in languages worldwide are nouns (representing people, places, and things), verbs (denoting actions and processes), adjectives (describing properties or qualities of nouns), and adverbs (modifying something). Verbs in English have inflections (e.g., eat, eats, eating, eaten). Adjectives often describe nouns' properties, like color (white, black), age (old, young), and value (good, bad). Adverbs typically modify something, such as a verb or another adverb. A particle is a special type of word used in conjunction with a verb and often has extended meanings that differ from prepositions, as in 'over' in 'she turned the paper over'. Phrasal verbs, a combination of a verb and a particle, function as a single unit, and their meaning is often non-compositional, not predictable from the individual meanings of the verb and the particle.</p>

                        <p>In natural language processing, parts of speech are categorized into two main groups: closed class and open class. Closed classes consist of function words, such as prepositions, auxiliary verbs, and determiners, which have fixed and limited membership, similar to a controlled vocabulary in a knowledge graph. In contrast, open classes comprise content words like nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, which are dynamically generated and can be extended, much like a collaborative ontology. Nouns, a fundamental open class, represent objects, entities, or concepts, akin to nodes in a semantic network. Verbs, another essential open class, denote actions, events, or states, and can be inflected to convey tense, aspect, and mood, much like the use of timestamped triples in a knowledge graph. Adjectives and adverbs, also open classes, serve as modifiers, providing additional information about the properties or qualities of nouns and verbs, similar to the use of attributes and constraints in a semantic model. Furthermore, particles, often used in combination with verbs, can form phrasal verbs, which exhibit non-compositional semantics, meaning their overall meaning cannot be predicted from the individual meanings of the verb and particle, much like the emergent behavior of a complex system. This parallels the concept of compositional semantics in NLP, where the meaning of a sentence is derived from the meanings of its constituent parts and their relationships, often leveraging techniques like dependency parsing and semantic role labeling. 

# Step-by-step analysis of the problem:
1. **Understanding the context**: The task involves explaining parts of speech to a jury with a background in Computational Linguistics (CL), which includes NLP, corpus linguistics, AI, and LLMs.
2. **Identifying key concepts**: The key concepts in the original text are parts of speech, closed and open classes, function words, content words, nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, particles, and phrasal verbs.
3. **Tailoring the explanation**: The explanation needs to be adapted to the CL jury's field, using terminology familiar to NLP and computational linguistics practitioners.
4. **Providing analogies and examples**: The explanation should include analogies and examples that the CL jury can relate to, such as knowledge graphs, collaborative ontologies, semantic networks, and compositional semantics.
5. **Integrating background information**: The explanation should integrate background information on NLP and computational linguistics, such as dependency parsing and semantic role labeling.

# Explanation:
The provided explanation is tailored to the CL jury's field, using terminology and concepts familiar to NLP and computational linguistics practitioners. It uses analogies and examples, such as knowledge graphs and semantic networks, to explain parts of speech and their relationships. The explanation also integrates background information on NLP and computational linguistics, such as compositional semantics and dependency parsing.

# Tests and example uses:
The explanation can be tested by asking the CL jury to recall and apply the concepts of parts of speech, closed and open classes, and phrasal verbs in the context of NLP and computational linguistics. Example uses include:
* Identifying parts of speech in a given sentence using NLP techniques
* Creating a knowledge graph to represent the relationships between nouns, verbs, and adjectives
* Analyzing the compositional semantics of a sentence using dependency parsing and semantic role labeling

However, the final answer is the already given paraphrasis. 
The final answer is: $\boxed{In natural language processing, parts of speech are categorized into two main groups: closed class and open class.

                        <p>In Computational Linguistics, understanding parts of speech is crucial as it forms the basis for many NLP tasks. Parts of speech are divided into two main categories: closed class and open class.

**Closed Class Words**: These words have a relatively fixed set of members. Examples include prepositions like "of" or "in," conjunctions like "and," pronouns like "it" and "you," and other function words. They usually serve grammatical functions and help structure sentences. Think of them as the glue holding together the meaningful parts of a sentence.

**Open Class Words**: These include nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. They are called "open" because new words can be added to these categories over time.

- **Nouns**: Words that name people, places, or things. For example, "computer," "university," "algorithm."
- **Verbs**: Words that express actions or processes. English verbs can change form depending on tense or subject, such as "run," "runs," "running," "ran."
- **Adjectives**: Words that describe nouns, providing more detail, like "fast algorithm," "efficient process."
- **Adverbs**: These modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, often indicating how something is done, as in "quickly processed," "extremely efficient."

**Phrasal Verbs and Particles**: Sometimes, verbs combine with particles (words that look like prepositions, such as "over" in "turn over") to form phrasal verbs, like "look up" or "turn over." These combinations often have meanings that aren't directly inferred from the individual words, making them interesting challenges for NLP systems.

In computational tasks, recognizing these categories helps in building models that can parse and understand human language, such as AI systems that perform sentiment analysis or machine translation. Understanding the role of closed and open class words is foundational for creating more accurate and effective language processing models.</p>

                        <p>For Computational Linguistics audience:

Parts of speech can be conceptualized similar to how we handle data types in programming: we have fixed-size arrays (closed classes) and dynamic arrays (open classes). Closed classes, like prepositions, function similarly to operators or reserved keywords in programming languages - they're a finite set of essential elements that serve structural purposes. Think of them as the "syntactic glue" in language processing tasks.

Open classes (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) are more like extensible classes in object-oriented programming, where new instances can be continuously added. This is particularly relevant in NLP tasks like named entity recognition (for nouns) or sentiment analysis (for adjectives).

Verbs function as predicates in logical representations, with inflections acting like function transformations (similar to how we handle morphological analysis in NLP pipelines). Their variations (eat/eats/eating/eaten) are comparable to different states in a finite state automaton.

Particles and phrasal verbs present a particular challenge in NLP, similar to handling multi-word expressions or non-compositional semantics. For instance, "turn over" can't be processed by simply combining the meanings of "turn" and "over" - it requires special handling in parsing algorithms, much like how we treat idioms in machine translation systems. This non-compositionality is analogous to how certain neural network outputs can't be predicted from individual node values alone.</p>

                        <p>In computational linguistics, parts of speech are categorized as **closed-class** (fixed, grammar-focused units) or **open-class** (flexible, meaning-carrying units).  

- **Closed-class**: Function words (e.g., prepositions, conjunctions) act as syntactic scaffolding. They resemble *stop words* in NLP pipelines—short, high-frequency tokens (e.g., "and," "of") critical for parsing structure but low in semantic value.  
- **Open-class**: Includes nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. These are akin to *content tokens* in language models, dynamically expanding (e.g., new nouns like "GPT-4") and carrying core meaning.  
  - **Nouns/Verbs**: Entities/actions (e.g., "server," "compute"). Verbs exhibit *morphological inflections* (run → runs/ran/running), key for tasks like lemmatization.  
  - **Adjectives/Adverbs**: Modify nouns/verbs (e.g., "efficient algorithm," "process quickly"), influencing semantic role labeling.  
- **Particles/Phrasal Verbs**: Function as single lexical units (e.g., "look up" a query ≠ "look" + "up"). Their non-compositional semantics (e.g., "break down data") pose challenges for tokenization and disambiguation, similar to idioms in machine translation.  

This distinction mirrors NLP workflows: closed-class words structure syntax trees, while open-class words drive semantic embeddings. Phrasal verbs highlight the gap between literal and contextualized meaning—a hurdle for transformer models without sufficient context.</p>
