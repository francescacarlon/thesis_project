                        <p>Parts of speech fall into two broad categories: closed class and open class. Closed classes are those with relatively fixed membership, such as prepositions [...]. By contrast, nouns and verbs are open classes [...]. Closed class words are generally function words like of, it, and, or you, which tend to be very short, occur frequently, and often have structuring uses in grammar. Four major open classes occur in the languages of the world: nouns [...], verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, [...]. Nouns are words for people, places, or things,  [...]. Verbs refer to actions and processes, including main verbs like draw, provide, and go. English verbs have inflections (non-third-person-singular (eat), third-person singular (eats), progressive (eating), past participle (eaten)). [...]. Adjectives often describe properties or qualities of nouns, like color (white, black), age (old, young), and value (good, bad), [...]. Adverbs generally modify something. [...] A particle [...] is used in combination with a verb. Particles often have extended meanings that aren't quite the same as the prepositions they resemble, as in the particle 'over' in 'she turned the paper over'. A phrasal verb and a particle acting as a single unit is called a phrasal verb. The meaning of phrasal verbs is often non-compositional - not predictable from the individual meanings of the verb and the particle. [...]</p>

                        <p>As a CS professional, you're familiar with structured data types and functions. In a similar vein, linguistic structures can be categorized into two main groups: closed and open classes.

    Closed classes are similar to fixed data types with a limited set of members, such as boolean values (true, false). By contrast, open classes are more flexible and can have multiple members like arrays or strings. Examples of open classes in language are nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.

    Nouns are words that denote objects or concepts, much like variables in programming, such as 'person', 'car', or 'apple'. Verbs, on the other hand, describe actions or processes, similar to functions in programming, like 'run', 'draw', or 'provide'. Unlike variables, English verbs have inflections, which alter their form based on context, such as 'eat' (third-person singular: 'eats'), 'eating' (progressive form), and 'eaten' (past participle).

    Adjectives serve to describe the properties or qualities of nouns, similar to how attributes modify variables in programming, for instance, 'red', 'old', or 'good'. Adverbs, on the other hand, modify other elements in a sentence, similar to how a function can modify the behavior of an object in programming.

    A particle is akin to a function modifier in programming. Particles are used in combination with verbs and often have extended meanings that aren't quite the same as prepositions, as seen in the particle 'over' in 'she turned the paper over'. A phrasal verb and a particle acting as a single unit is called a phrasal verb. The meaning of phrasal verbs can be non-compositional, meaning their meaning isn't always predictable from the individual meanings of the verb and the particle, much like complex functions can be hard to understand without understanding their purpose in the larger program.</p>

                        <p>In programming, you deal with different data types, each serving a specific purpose. Similarly, in linguistics, words can be categorized into two primary classes: closed class and open class. Think of these classes as libraries or modules, each containing a distinct set of words with unique functions.

    Closed class words, like prepositions, can be compared to utility functions in your code, such as printf() or scanf(). They are short, occur frequently, and play a crucial role in structuring the grammar of a sentence. These function words, including of, it, and, or you, are like the glue that holds the code together, providing context and meaning to the surrounding words.

    On the other hand, open class words are like the variables in your program. They can be nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs, each representing a different data type. Nouns, for instance, are like object references, pointing to people, places, or things. Verbs, similar to functions, describe actions and processes, such as draw, provide, or go. Just as functions can have different parameters and return types, English verbs have inflections, like non-third-person-singular (eat), third-person singular (eats), progressive (eating), and past participle (eaten).

    Adjectives can be thought of as properties or attributes of nouns, like the color, age, or value of an object. They describe the characteristics of a noun, just as you would use attributes to describe an object in your code. Adverbs, on the other hand, modify or describe the behavior of verbs, similar to how you would use a modifier to change the behavior of a function.

    Now, consider particles, which are like special operators in your code. They can be used in combination with verbs to create phrasal verbs, which are like custom functions. The meaning of these phrasal verbs is often non-compositional, meaning it's not immediately apparent from the individual meanings of the verb and particle. For example, the particle 'over' in'she turned the paper over' has an extended meaning that's different from its usual meaning as a preposition. This is similar to how a custom function in your code can have a unique behavior that's not immediately obvious from its individual components. 

    By understanding these concepts, you can better appreciate the structure and complexity of language, just as you would with a well-designed program. The relationships between words, like the relationships between functions and variables, are crucial to creating meaningful and effective communication.</p>

                        <p>In language, parts of speech can be divided into two main types: closed class and open class. Let's compare this to data structures. Closed classes are like static arrays; their size or membership doesn't change much. Examples include prepositions like "of" or "in," which are commonly used to structure sentences but don't vary. 

On the other hand, open classes are like dynamic arrays or lists; they can expand with new entries. These include nouns (words for people, places, or things), verbs (actions or processes like "run" or "build"), adjectives (describing qualities like "fast" or "efficient"), and adverbs (modifying actions, such as "quickly" or "silently").

Verbs in English can change form (similar to how a function might take different parameters). For instance, "run" can become "runs," "running," or "ran," depending on usage.

Now, let's talk about particles. Think of particles as modifiers that adjust the meaning of verbs, similar to how decorators can modify a function's behavior in programming. For instance, in the phrasal verb "turn over," "over" changes the meaning of "turn." The combined meaning isn't always clear from the individual parts, much like how the result of a decorated function can't always be predicted just by looking at the function itself and its decorator. 

Understanding these concepts helps in parsing and generating language structures, much like how understanding data structures and algorithms is key to effective programming.</p>

                        <p>Here's my adaptation for CS practitioners:

In programming languages, tokens can be classified into two main types: reserved keywords (closed set) and user-defined identifiers (open set). Similar to how programming languages have a fixed set of keywords like 'if', 'while', or 'return' that can't be modified, natural languages have closed-class words that serve as structural operators (like 'of', 'and'). These are analogous to operators and delimiters in programming.

The open classes work like user-defined variables and functions - you can always create new ones. Just as you can define new variables and functions in your code, languages allow creation of new nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Nouns are like objects or class instances, verbs are like functions performing actions (with built-in method overloading for different forms like 'eat'/'eats'/'eating'), adjectives are like attributes or properties of objects, and adverbs are like function modifiers.

Particles in phrasal verbs are similar to method chaining in object-oriented programming, where 'turn.over()' would mean something different from just 'turn()'. Like how the combination of methods can create emergent behavior different from individual methods, phrasal verbs have non-compositional semantics - their meaning can't be derived by simply combining their components, similar to how some design patterns create functionality beyond their individual parts.</p>

                        <p>In computational terms, lexical categories can be partitioned into static and dynamic sets. Static sets resemble reserved keywords in programming languages - finite, immutable elements (e.g., operators like "&&" or syntax tokens like "import") that structure code flow. Dynamic sets mirror user-defined types - extensible classes like objects (nouns: User, Database), methods (verbs: sort(), train()), properties (adjectives: is_trained, max_depth), and decorators (adverbs: recursively, efficiently).  

Morphological variations in verbs parallel method overloading: run(), runs(), running(), ran() represent different execution states. Phrasal verbs act like API endpoints where verb+particle combinations (break_down(), look_up()) create unique semantic endpoints through lexical composition, similar to how tf.math.reduce_mean() encapsulates specific tensor operations beyond literal interpretation. Static-class tokens (of, the, while) function as syntactic glue, optimizing information density like pointers/references rather than storing direct data payloads.</p>
