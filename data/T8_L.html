                        <p>The importance of the computation graph comes from the backward pass, which is used to compute the derivatives that we'll need for the weight update. [...] Backwards differentiation makes use of the chain rule [...]. Suppose we are computing the derivative of a composite function f(x) = u(v(x)). The derivative of f(x) is the derivative of u(x) with respect to v(x) times the derivative of v(x) with respect to x. [...] The chain rule extends to more than two functions. If computing the derivative of a composite function f(x) = u(v(w(x))), the derivative of f(x) is: df/dx = du/dv·dv/dw·dw/dx. The intuition of backward differentiation is to pass gradients back from the final node to all the nodes in the graph. [...] Each node takes an upstream gradient that is passed in from its parent node to the right, and for each of its inputs computes a local gradient (the gradient of its output with respect to its input), and uses the chain rule to multiply these two to compute a downstream gradient to be passed on to the next earlier node. Let's now compute the 3 derivatives we need. Since in the computation graph L = ce, we can directly compute the derivative ∂L/∂c: ∂L/∂c = e. For the other two, we'll need to use the chain rule: ∂L/∂a=∂L/∂e*∂e/∂a [and] ∂L/∂b=∂L/∂e*∂e/∂d*∂d/∂b.</p>

                    <p>Let me explain backward differentiation using concepts familiar to linguistics students:

Just as we analyze sentences from larger structures down to their smallest components, backward differentiation works by starting from the final output and moving backwards through each step. Think of it like decomposing a complex sentence into its constituent parts.

The chain rule is similar to how we break down nested clauses in syntax trees. If we have a sentence with multiple embedded clauses, we need to understand how each clause relates to the others. Similarly, when we have a sequence of mathematical operations, we need to understand how changes in one part affect the whole.

Let's use a linguistic analogy: Imagine analyzing how a change in word stress (x) affects the overall meaning of an utterance (f). If this relationship passes through intermediate effects on intonation (w), which affects phrase boundaries (v), which finally influences meaning (u), we need to consider each step's contribution. Just as meaning changes cascade through different linguistic levels, the chain rule shows us how changes flow backward through each calculation step.

In our computation graph, each node is like a morpheme that contributes to the final meaning. Just as a morpheme's meaning combines with others to create word meaning, each node takes information from later calculations (upstream) and passes modified information to earlier calculations (downstream), multiplying the effects at each step.

When we calculate derivatives like ∂L/∂c, ∂L/∂a, and ∂L/∂b, we're essentially tracing back through our calculation path, similar to how we might trace semantic change through historical linguistics, seeing how each change influences the final result.</p>

                    <p>1. The computation graph in machine learning is crucial for its backward pass, which calculates the needed derivatives for updating the weights during the learning process. The principal tool used in this process is chain rule from calculus.

    2. Let's imagine a complex function f(x) that is the result of multiple operations u(v(x)). To calculate the derivative of this function, we use the chain rule. Specifically, the derivative of f(x) is the derivative of u(x) with respect to v(x) times the derivative of v(x) with respect to x.

    3. Consider a simple example of the chain rule applied to a composite function f(x) = u(v(w(x))). The derivative of f(x) can be calculated as follows: df/dx = du/dv·dv/dw·dw/dx.

    4. The chain rule's fundamental principle is that it allows us to "pass" the gradients from the final node backward through the entire graph. Each node in the graph receives an upstream gradient from its parent node, computes local gradients (gradients of the output with respect to its input), and then passes downstream gradients to the next earlier node using the chain rule.

    5. Let's calculate the derivatives we need for our example. Suppose our computation graph is L = ce, the derivative of L with respect to c is straightforward: ∂L/∂c = e. To find the derivatives with respect to a and b, we'll use the chain rule: ∂L/∂a = ∂L/∂e * ∂e/∂a and ∂L/∂b = ∂L/∂e * ∂e/∂d * ∂d/∂b.</p>
