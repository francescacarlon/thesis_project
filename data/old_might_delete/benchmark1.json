                    "prompt1": "In the realm of linguistics, words can be categorized into two main types: closed and open classes. Closed classes, such as prepositions (like 'in' or 'on'), have a limited set of members. On the other hand, open classes, including nouns (e.g., 'person' or 'car') and verbs (e.g., 'draw' or 'go'), have a more dynamic and flexible membership.\n\n     Closed class words are typically function words, such as 'the,' 'and,' or 'or.' They are short, common, and often play a crucial role in structuring sentences. For instance, English function words like 'the' and 'and' help to denote the subject and connect sentences, respectively.\n\n     English has four major open classes: nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.\n\n     Nouns represent entities like people, places, or things. For example, 'student,' 'classroom,' or 'book.'\n\n     Verbs signify actions or processes. Some examples include 'draw,' 'provide,' or 'go.' English verbs can have inflections, such as the third-person singular form (eats) and the progressive form (eating).\n\n     Adjectives usually describe the properties or qualities of nouns. For instance, 'red' or 'old' can describe a 'car.'\n\n     Adverbs generally modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. An example of an adverb is 'quickly.'\n\n     A particle is a type of word that combines with a verb, like 'over' in 'she turned the paper over.' Particles often have meanings that differ from their prepositional counterparts, as in the case of the particle 'over' in the example above.\n\n     When a particle becomes associated with a verb, forming a single unit, it is called a phrasal verb. Phrasal verbs often have meanings that are not straightforward combinations of the individual verb and particle meanings. For example, the phrasal verb 'turn over' does not mean simply 'to turn' and 'over.' Instead, it implies a complete action or process, such as revealing or changing the position of something.",
                    "prompt2": "As a CS professional, you're familiar with structured data types and functions. In a similar vein, linguistic structures can be categorized into two main groups: closed and open classes.\n\n    Closed classes are similar to fixed data types with a limited set of members, such as boolean values (true, false). By contrast, open classes are more flexible and can have multiple members like arrays or strings. Examples of open classes in language are nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.\n\n    Nouns are words that denote objects or concepts, much like variables in programming, such as 'person', 'car', or 'apple'. Verbs, on the other hand, describe actions or processes, similar to functions in programming, like 'run', 'draw', or 'provide'. Unlike variables, English verbs have inflections, which alter their form based on context, such as 'eat' (third-person singular: 'eats'), 'eating' (progressive form), and 'eaten' (past participle).\n\n    Adjectives serve to describe the properties or qualities of nouns, similar to how attributes modify variables in programming, for instance, 'red', 'old', or 'good'. Adverbs, on the other hand, modify other elements in a sentence, similar to how a function can modify the behavior of an object in programming.\n\n    A particle is akin to a function modifier in programming. Particles are used in combination with verbs and often have extended meanings that aren't quite the same as prepositions, as seen in the particle 'over' in 'she turned the paper over'. A phrasal verb and a particle acting as a single unit is called a phrasal verb. The meaning of phrasal verbs can be non-compositional, meaning their meaning isn't always predictable from the individual meanings of the verb and the particle, much like complex functions can be hard to understand without understanding their purpose in the larger program.",

Closed classes, such as prepositions, are characterized by a limited number of members, while open classes, like nouns and verbs, have an infinite number.\n\n    Closed class words, typically function words, include prepositions, conjunctions, and pronouns. They are brief, prevalent, and often serve structural purposes within grammar. Examples of prepositions include 'of', 'it', 'and', 'or'.\n\n    Four primary open classes exist across the world's languages: nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Nouns represent people, places, or things, while verbs denote actions or processes. English verbs exhibit inflections, such as third-person-singular (eat) and past participle (eaten).\n\n    Adjectives typically describe nouns' properties or qualities, like color (white, black), age (old, young), or value (good, bad). Adverbs generally modify other words and phrases, such as time (quickly), place (above), or manner (carefully).\n\n    A particle is a type of function word that combines with a verb, extending its meaning beyond that of a simple preposition. For example, consider the use of 'over' in the sentence 'she turned the paper over', where 'over' acts as a particle.\n\n    When a verb and a particle combine into a single unit, we call it a phrasal verb. Phrasal verbs often have non-compositional meanings, meaning their meaning cannot be predicted by combining the individual meanings of the verb and particle.",

Closed classes have a limited set of members, such as prepositions like 'of' or 'in'. On the other hand, nouns and verbs belong to the open classes, which have an almost infinite number of members.\n\n    Closed class words, like prepositions, are primarily function words. These words, such as 'of', 'it', 'and', or 'or', are typically short, occur frequently, and play a key role in organizing grammar structure.\n\n    Four primary open classes that you'll encounter in various languages are nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Nouns refer to people, places, or things, like 'John', 'Paris', or 'book'.\n\n    Verbs describe actions and processes, for example, 'draw', 'provide', or 'go'. English verbs have inflections that change their form based on context, such as 'eat' (non-third person singular) vs 'eats' (third person singular), 'eating' (progressive), and 'eaten' (past participle).\n\n    Adjectives characterize or describe nouns, such as 'color' (white, black), 'age' (old, young), or 'value' (good, bad).

Closed-set classes have a limited number of members, like prepositions such as in, on, and at. In contrast, nouns and verbs belong to the open-set classes, which are extensible and can have an infinite number of members (e.g., dog, cat, and run, walk).\n\n    Closed-set words, or function words, typically include short, frequently occurring words like of, it, and, or, which often serve a grammatical structuring purpose.\n\n    Four fundamental open-set classes exist across languages: nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Nouns represent people, places, or things (e.g., teacher, classroom, book). Verbs denote actions or processes, such as draw, provide, or go. English verbs have inflections to express various forms, like drawing (present tense), provided (past tense), and drawing (progressive tense).\n\n    Adjectives describe the properties or qualities of nouns, like color (red, blue), age (young, old), or value (good, bad). Adverbs modify something and can be found in sentences to provide additional information about the verb, adjective, or other adverbs (e.g., quickly, loudly, or carefully).\n\n    Particles are a type of word that work together with verbs to create more complex meanings. For example, the particle 'over' in 'she turned the paper over' doesn't have the same meaning as the preposition 'over.' When a verb and a particle work as a single unit, it's called a phrasal verb. Phrasal verbs often have non-compositional meanings, meaning their meaning isn't predictable from the individual meanings of the verb and the particle.\n\n    By crafting clear and engaging explanations, you can showcase your expertise in bridging linguistics and computer science, captivating publishing houses, and boosting your career prospects as a successful copywriter.",
                    "prompt4": "For the computational linguistics practitioner, the classification of words into two main categories - closed and open classes - is crucial. Closed classes are characterized by a relatively fixed membership, such as prepositions (e.g., in, on, with), which contrast with open classes like nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Closed class words, often function words, have structuring uses in grammar, are typically short, and occur frequently (e.g., you, and, or). The four primary open classes found in languages worldwide are nouns (representing people, places, and things), verbs (denoting actions and processes), adjectives (describing properties or qualities of nouns), and adverbs (modifying something). Verbs in English have inflections (e.g., eat, eats, eating, eaten). Adjectives often describe nouns' properties, like color (white, black), age (old, young), and value (good, bad). Adverbs typically modify something, such as a verb or another adverb. A particle is a special type of word used in conjunction with a verb and often has extended meanings that differ from prepositions, as in 'over' in 'she turned the paper over'. Phrasal verbs, a combination of a verb and a particle, function as a single unit, and their meaning is often non-compositional, not predictable from the individual meanings of the verb and the particle.",
                    "prompt5": "1. For those versed in linguistics, it's essential to understand the difference between closed and open classes in language. Here, closed classes consist of words with limited members like prepositions, while open classes are more extensive, such as nouns and verbs. Closed class words, like the function words 'of', 'it', 'and', or 'you', have fixed uses in grammar structures, are short and frequent, and often provide the skeleton of a sentence. Four main categories belong to open classes: nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Nouns (people, places, or things), verbs (actions and processes), adjectives (descriptions of nouns), and adverbs (modifiers of other parts of speech), are the fundamental elements in language.\n\n    2. Imagine constructing a sentence using a set of building blocks, where closed class words are the bricks that hold the structure together, while open class words are the figures that bring meaning to the sentence. Closed class words include prepositions, while open class words include nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. To give you an example, consider the sentence \"She turned the paper over.\" Here, 'she' is a noun, 'turned' is a verb, 'paper' is a noun, and 'over' is a preposition that functions as a particle, altering the meaning of the verb 'turned' without having a parallel in prepositions. This combination of a verb and a particle is referred to as a phrasal verb. The meaning of phrasal verbs is not always predictable by combining the meaning of the individual words."

Similarly, in linguistics, words can be categorized into two main classes: closed class and open class. Think of these classes as data structures, where closed classes are like fixed-size arrays with a limited set of elements, such as prepositions, while open classes are like dynamic arrays or linked lists that can grow and shrink, comprising nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.\n\nClosed class words can be thought of as utility functions in programming, serving specific purposes like structuring sentences. They are usually short, occur frequently, and have defined uses in grammar, much like how functions like `sort()` or `reverse()` have specific purposes in programming. \n\nOpen class words, on the other hand, are like data objects that can be created, modified, and extended. The four primary open classes are nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Nouns can be considered as objects or instances, representing people, places, or things, similar to how objects are instantiated in object-oriented programming. Verbs are like methods or functions that perform actions, such as `draw()`, `provide()`, or `go()`, and they often have different states or inflections, similar to how functions can have different parameters or return types.\n\nAdjectives can be seen as properties or attributes of nouns, describing qualities like color, age, or value, much like how objects have attributes in object-oriented programming. Adverbs, which modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, can be thought of as decorators or higher-order functions that alter the behavior or properties of their targets.\n\nFurthermore, particles can be considered as special types of tokens that combine with verbs to form phrasal verbs, acting as a single unit. The meaning of these phrasal verbs can be non-compositional, meaning it's not directly predictable from the individual meanings of the verb and the particle, similar to how the output of a function can depend on the interaction of its parameters and internal state. This concept is analogous to how the behavior of a program can emerge from the interactions of its components, rather than being predictable from the components alone. \n\nBy understanding these linguistic concepts through the lens of computer science, you can better appreciate the structure and organization of language, much like how you analyze and design software systems.

                    "prompt1": "In Computational Linguistics, we often deal with the concept of syntactic constituency, which is essentially the idea that a group of words can function as a single unit, similar to how a single token works in a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline. This concept is crucial in understanding how phrases, such as noun phrases, can be treated as individual entities in a sentence. For instance, in the sentence \"three parties from Brooklyn arrive,\" the phrase \"three parties from Brooklyn\" acts as a single unit, or constituent, that precedes the verb \"arrive.\"\n\n    To model and analyze these constituent structures, we use a formal system called context-free grammar (CFG), which is a fundamental concept in both linguistics and computer science. A CFG consists of a set of production rules that define how symbols, such as words or phrases, can be combined and ordered to form valid sentences. These rules are often represented in a hierarchical manner, allowing for the creation of complex phrases from simpler components. For example, a noun phrase (NP) can be composed of a determiner (Det) followed by a nominal, and the Det can be further specified as either \"a\" or \"the.\"\n\n    The process of applying these production rules to generate a sentence is called a derivation, and it can be visually represented as a parse tree. This tree illustrates how the sentence is broken down into its constituent parts, with the root of the tree representing the highest level of abstraction. By using a CFG, we can define a formal language that consists of all the possible sentences that can be generated using the grammar. Sentences that can be derived from the grammar are considered grammatical, while those that cannot are deemed ungrammatical.\n\n    This concept of formal languages and generative grammar is essential in CL, as it allows us to model and analyze the structure of natural languages using computational methods. By applying these concepts, we can better understand how language works and develop more sophisticated NLP tools and models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), to process and generate human-like language. The use of CFGs and parse trees is also closely related to other areas of CL, such as corpus linguistics and artificial intelligence, where they are used to analyze and generate language data. \n\n    To illustrate this concept further, consider the analogy of a recipe. Just as a recipe provides a set of instructions for combining ingredients to create a dish, a CFG provides a set of rules for combining words to create a sentence. The parse tree represents the steps involved in preparing the dish, with each node in the tree corresponding to a specific ingredient or cooking instruction. By following the recipe, or in this case, the CFG, we can generate a wide range of dishes, or sentences, that are grammatically correct and meaningful. This analogy highlights the power of formal languages and generative grammar in CL, and how they can be used to model and analyze the complex structures of human language. \n\n    In summary, syntactic constituency and context-free grammar are fundamental concepts in CL that allow us to model and analyze the structure of natural languages. By understanding how words can function as single units and how sentences can be generated using a set of production rules, we can develop more sophisticated NLP tools and models that can process and generate human-like language. The application of these concepts has far-reaching implications for areas such as language translation, sentiment analysis, and text generation, and is a key area of research in the field of CL. \n\n### END OF OUTPUT ###"

Let's break down the concepts of semantic roles, verbs, and their arguments to help you better understand our AI products.\n\n     Semantic roles are a method to categorize the relationships between verbs and their arguments (i.e., subjects, objects, etc.) in a sentence. These roles generalize the commonality among different verbs and their associated participants.\n\n     For instance, consider the verbs 'break' and 'open'. The subjects performing these actions (like Sasha and Pat) are known as agents. They are volitional entities responsible for the action's outcome. In the case of 'break', the broken object is the theme.\n\n     In programming terms, consider a function call with parameters. The function (verb) takes an input (argument or theme) and performs an operation on it, producing an output (result or theme). Similarly, the function (verb) can also have additional parameters, such as the instrument used to break or open something.\n\n     Understanding semantic roles can help you grasp the various ways a verb can take arguments, also known as verb alternations or diathesis alternations. For example, while the agent is often the subject of the sentence, in some cases, the theme can be the subject.\n\n     Here are some examples:\n     - John broke the window.

In CS, we label these subjects as agents. The thematic role term for this concept is AGENT.

For example, the agent is usually the subject of the sentence, but in some cases, the object could be the subject instead.\n\n     Using our previous example, we can say that:\n     - John broke the glass. (John is the agent, and the glass is the theme.)\n     - John broke the glass with a hammer. (John is the agent, the glass is the theme, and the hammer is the instrument.)\n     - The hammer broke the glass. (The hammer is the agent, and the glass is the theme.)\n     - The glass is broken. (The glass is the theme, with no explicit agent mentioned.)\n     - The glass was broken by John. (John is the agent, and the glass is the theme.)\n\n     These examples demonstrate that the verb \"break\" has at least three possible arguments: agent, theme, and instrument.\n\n     These different ways of structuring a verb's arguments, also known as verb alternations or diathesis alternations, provide a more general understanding of how sentences are constructed and how different elements contribute to the meaning of a sentence.",
                    "prompt3": "For CL students, understanding thematic roles is crucial for analyzing the structure of sentences, especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n\n     Consider the sentences \"Sasha smashed the vase\" and \"Pat closed the door\". Sasha and Pat (AGENTS) are the intentional entities initiating the actions, and we can refer to them as the 'doers' of the 'smashing' and 'closing' events, respectively.\n\n     The entities affected by the actions, the vase and the door, are the THEMES of the sentences. In this context, the THEME is the entity undergoing the action.\n\n     AGENT and THEME are two thematic roles that capture the common semantics between 'doers' and 'affected' entities. In our sentences, the AGENT is Sasha or Pat, while the THEME is the vase or the door.\n\n     Moreover, there are other thematic roles like INSTRUMENT (a tool used to perform an action), such as the rock in the sentence \"John smashed the vase with a rock\".\n\n     Understanding thematic roles helps generalize across different sentence structures, as the same verb can have multiple argument structures. For instance, while the AGENT is usually the subject of the sentence, the THEME can also be the subject in some instances. For example, \"The vase was smashed by John\" has John as the AGENT and the vase as the THEME, even though the sentence order is reversed from \"John smashed the vase\".\n\n     These different argument structure realizations are known as verb alternations or diathesis alternations.\n\n     By examining the possible arguments of a verb, such as AGENT, THEME, and INSTRUMENT, we can better understand how the sentence is structured and how the entities are interacting within it.",

Agents are the primary subjects causing an action or event and are often animate. The objects affected by these actions, like the broken window or the opened door, are referred to as themes. Semantic roles, such as agents and themes, help generalize across various sentence structures by providing a common framework for understanding the relationships between subjects, objects, and verbs. In addition to agents and themes, verbs sometimes have additional arguments, like instruments, such as a rock in the example of breaking the window.

The objects affected by these actions, like the broken window and opened door, are referred to as themes. The instrumental role, represented by a tool or means, is optional for verbs like \"break\" and \"open\", but it can be present, as in the example with John breaking the window with a rock.

This phenomenon is known as verb alternations or diathesis alternations.\n\n    2. Corpus Linguistics Audience:\n\n    This text presents the analysis of thematic roles in sentences involving the verbs \"break\" and \"open\". The agent is the active subject performing the action (Sasha for breaking the window, Pat for opening the door). The theme represents the object affected by the action (the broken window, the opened door). The instrumental role, if present, indicates the means by which the action is performed (a rock used by John to break the window).

Artificial Intelligence Audience:\n\n    This text discusses the thematic roles in sentences involving the verbs \"break\" and \"open\". The agent is the active subject carrying out the action (Sasha for breaking the window, Pat for opening the door). The theme represents the object undergoing the action (the broken window, the opened door). The instrumental role, if present, shows the means by which the action is performed (a rock used by John to break the window).

NLP Audience:\n\n    This text explores the thematic roles in sentences with the verbs \"break\" and \"open\". The agent is the active subject executing the action (Sasha for breaking the window, Pat for opening the door). The theme represents the object experiencing the action (the broken window, the opened door). The instrumental role, if present, signifies the tool or means used for the action (a rock used by John to break the window). Semantic roles facilitate the generalization of roles across various sentence structures, such as changing the subject to the object, which is called verb alternations or diathesis alternations.\n\n    5. Linguistics Audience:\n\n    In this text, the thematic role analysis in sentences using the verbs \"break\" and \"open\" is presented. The agent is the active subject causing the action (Sasha for breaking the window, Pat for opening the door).

The final output of the network is calculated using similar steps from the output layer, but instead of a sigmoid function, we might use a different function depending on the task the network is designed to accomplish.\n\n    2. **Category:** Linguists who want to understand how Neural Networks process language data\n\n    In the field of computational linguistics, we use neural networks to analyze and process language data. These networks consist of three main parts: input units, hidden units, and output units. The input units represent the raw language data, such as words, sentences, or paragraphs.\n\n    The hidden units perform computations on the input data and pass it on to the output units. In the feedforward network, all hidden units are connected to all input units, and all hidden units are connected to all output units. These connections have weights and biases, which help adjust the importance of the features in the language data as it passes through the network.\n\n    To calculate the output of the hidden layer, we multiply the weighted input values by each hidden unit's weight, add the biases, and then apply an activation function, such as the sigmoid, tanh, or ReLU function. The final output of the network is calculated using similar steps from the output layer and a different activation function, depending on the task the network is designed to accomplish, such as classifying language patterns or generating new language data.\n\n    Neural networks have been widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to address various tasks, ranging from text classification, translation, and question answering, to generating realistic-sounding text. In essence, they mimic the structure and function of the human brain to learn patterns and make decisions based on the input data, making them powerful tools for processing and understanding language data."

The concept of backward differentiation is to transmit gradients backward from the final node to all nodes in the graph. Each node takes the gradient received from its parent node and computes its local gradient, then uses the chain rule to calculate the downstream gradient to pass on to the next earlier node.\n\n    5. For instance, let's calculate the three derivatives we need in our computation graph, where L=ce. We can directly compute the derivative ∂L/∂c: ∂L/∂c = e.

LSTM Networks: A Solution to the Vanishing Gradients Problem in RNNs\n\n    Recall that Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network that processes sequences of data, where the hidden state is updated based on the previous hidden state and the current input. However, RNNs struggle with long term dependencies, as the information encoded in the hidden states is typically local and more relevant to recent parts of the input sequence and recent decisions. This issue arises due to the vanishing gradients problem, where gradients are driven to zero, making it difficult for the network to learn effectively from distant parts of the input sequence.\n\n    To tackle these challenges, LSTM Networks have been developed, which explicitly manage the task of maintaining relevant context over time. LSTMs allow the network to learn to forget information that is no longer needed and remember information required for decisions still to come.\n\n    ### 1. LSTM Network Architecture\n\n    LSTMs are an extension of RNNs and consist of three main components: the forget gate, the input gate, and the output gate. These components are designed to manage the flow of information in and out of the units, allowing the network to selectively forget and remember relevant information.\n\n    ### 2. The Forget Gate\n\n    The forget gate decides which information to delete from the context, ensuring that the network focuses on the most important parts of the input sequence. This helps address the vanishing gradients problem by preventing irrelevant information from accumulating and overwhelming the network.\n\n    ### 3. The Input Gate\n\n    The input gate selects the information to add to the current context, ensuring that the network considers only the most relevant information for the task at hand. This helps improve the quality of the hidden state and enables the network to make better decisions.\n\n    ### 4. The Output Gate\n\n    The output gate determines which information is required for the current hidden state, allowing the network to focus on the relevant information and ignore the rest. This helps the network make more accurate predictions and improve its overall performance.\n\n    ### 5. LSTM Network Implementation\n\n    LSTMs introduce an explicit context layer to the architecture, which allows the network to maintain a memory of the input sequence over time. The gates in LSTMs are controlled through the use of additional weights that operate sequentially on the input, previous hidden state, and previous context layer. This enables the network to adapt to different input sequences and tasks.\n\n    ### Conclusion\n\n    LSTM Networks are an essential tool in addressing the vanishing gradients problem in RNNs and improving the long-term dependency issue. By explicitly managing the flow of information in and out of the units, LSTMs enable the network to selectively forget and remember relevant information, resulting in improved performance on tasks that require long-term dependencies.",
