Closed class words are generally function words like of, it, and, or you, which tend to be very short, occur frequently, and often have structuring uses in grammar. Four major open classes occur in the languages of the world: nouns [...], verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, [...]. Nouns are words for people, places, or things,  [...]. Verbs refer to actions and processes, including main verbs like draw, provide, and go. English verbs have inflections (non-third-person-singular (eat), third-person singular (eats), progressive (eating), past participle (eaten)). [...]. Adjectives often describe properties or qualities of nouns, like color (white, black), age (old, young), and value (good, bad), [...]. Adverbs generally modify something.

        "CS_tailored_gpt4o": "When discussing parts of speech in language, we categorize them into two main groups: closed class and open class. For those with a computer science background, think of closed class words as akin to reserved keywords in programming languages. Just like reserved keywords (e.g., if, else, while) have a fixed function and are limited in number, closed class words like prepositions (e.g., of, it, and, or you) have specific grammatical roles and are relatively stable across the language.\n\nOn the other hand, open class words are more like user-defined variables or function names in your code. Just as you can create new variables or functions as needed, open class words like nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs can expand with new entries. For example, nouns are akin to objects or data types representing people, places, or things (e.g., 'server', 'array'). Verbs are like methods or functions that perform actions or processes, such as 'execute', 'render', or 'compile'. In English, verbs can change form depending on their tense, much like how a function might have different signatures or overloads.\n\nAdjectives are similar to parameters passed to functions; they describe properties or qualities, such as size ('large'), color ('blue'), or status ('active'). Adverbs, which often modify verbs, are like modifiers or flags that alter the behavior of a function, such as 'quickly' or 'efficiently'.\n\nAdditionally, consider particles as modifiers that change the meaning of a verb, similar to how a flag might change a function's behavior. In a phrase like 'turn over', 'over' modifies 'turn', creating a phrasal verb. This is comparable to a method call that behaves differently when specific flags are used, with the combined meaning not always deducible from the individual parts.\n\nUnderstanding these linguistic structures can be valuable when developing AI models dealing with natural language processing, as it aids in parsing and analyzing text effectively.",

        "CL_tailored_gpt4o": "**Tailored Explanation for Computational Linguistics Clients:**\n\nIn the study of language, words are generally divided into two main categories: closed class and open class. For computational linguists, understanding these distinctions is crucial for tasks like part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing.\n\n**Closed Class Words:** These are words with a fixed set of members, such as prepositions and conjunctions. Examples include words like \"of,\" \"it,\" \"and,\" and \"you.\" These words are often short and frequently used in language processing tasks as they serve grammatical functions that help structure sentences. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), identifying these can assist in creating more precise syntactic structures.\n\n**Open Class Words:** These are categories that can easily accept new members and include nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Computational linguists often deal with:\n\n- **Nouns:** These words represent people, places, or things (e.g., \"computer,\" \"city\"). They are crucial for entity recognition tasks in NLP.\n  \n- **Verbs:** Indicating actions or processes, verbs such as \"run,\" \"analyze,\" and \"develop\" are essential in dependency parsing and understanding sentence syntax. They can change form based on tense or subject (e.g., \"eat,\" \"eats,\" \"eating\").\n  \n- **Adjectives:** These words describe qualities or attributes of nouns, such as \"fast,\" \"efficient,\" or \"complex.\" They are often used in sentiment analysis to determine the emotional tone of a statement.\n\n- **Adverbs:** Modifying verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, these words (e.g., \"quickly,\" \"very\") add detail to actions or descriptions.\n\n**Phrasal Verbs:** These consist of a verb paired with a particle, which can sometimes resemble prepositions but carry distinct meanings. For instance, \"turn over\" in \"she turned the paper over\" is a phrasal verb. Understanding these is key in NLP as their meanings are often non-compositional, meaning they can't be deduced from the individual meanings of their parts.\n\nIn essence, for computational linguists, mastering these categories aids in designing more accurate language models and enhances tasks such as parsing and semantic analysis.

Consider the noun phrase, a sequence of words surrounding at least one noun. [...] they can all appear in similar syntactic environments, for example, before a verb: 'three parties from Brooklyn arrive'. [...] A widely used formal system for modeling constituent structure in natural language is the context-free grammar (CFG). [...] A context-free grammar consists of a set of rules or productions, each of which expresses the ways that symbols of the language can be grouped and ordered together, and a lexicon of words and symbols. [...] an NP (or noun phrase) can be composed of either a ProperNoun or a determiner (Det) followed by a Nominal; [...]. Context-free rules can be hierarchically  embedded, [...]: Det → a, Det → the, Noun → flight. [...] Thus, a CFG can be used to generate a set of strings. This sequence of rule expansions is called a derivation of the string of words. It is common to represent a derivation by a parse tree (commonly shown inverted with the root at the top). [...]. A CFG like that of L0 defines a formal language. Sentences (strings of words) that can be derived by a grammar are in the formal language defined by that grammar, and are called grammatical sentences.

For instance, in the sentence 'three parties from Brooklyn arrive,' 'three parties from Brooklyn' acts as a single unit or noun phrase.\n\nA common method for modeling these structures is called context-free grammar (CFG). Think of CFG as a set of rules similar to the syntax rules you use in programming languages. These rules define how different parts of a sentence, like nouns and verbs, can be combined and ordered. For example, a noun phrase (NP) could be a proper noun or a determiner (like 'a' or 'the') followed by a noun, such as in 'the flight.'\n\nJust as you might build a software module using smaller functions, CFG rules can be combined and layered to create more complex structures. This process of expanding rules is akin to calling functions within functions, and the resulting sequence of words is known as a derivation.\n\nTo visualize how these rules work together, we use parse trees, similar to abstract syntax trees in programming, which help us understand the hierarchical structure of sentences.

If a sentence cannot be constructed using the CFG, it's considered ungrammatical.\n\nIn linguistics, using these formal systems to model how natural languages work is known as generative grammar.

One key concept here is syntactic constituency, which refers to the way words can form units or \"constituents\" in a sentence. For example, consider a noun phrase (NP), which is a cluster of words built around a noun, such as in \"three parties from Brooklyn arrive\". This NP acts as a single unit that can fit into various sentence structures, like appearing before a verb.\n\nTo model these structures, we often use a formal system called context-free grammar (CFG). A CFG consists of rules that define how smaller parts of a language (like words and symbols) can be combined to form larger structures (such as sentences). For example, a simple rule might state that a noun phrase (NP) can be either a ProperNoun or a sequence consisting of a determiner (Det) followed by a Nominal, like \"the flight\". \n\nThese rules can be layered to form complex structures, much like building blocks. For instance, the rule Det → \"the\" or Det → \"a\" helps specify which words can act as determiners. The word \"flight\" can be categorized under the rule Noun → \"flight\". By applying these rules, a CFG generates strings of words, known as derivations, which can be visualized using parse trees. These trees map out the structure of a sentence, showing how each word fits into the overall grammatical framework.\n\nA CFG defines a formal language, which includes all sentences that can be created using its rules. Sentences that match this structure are termed grammatical, while those that don't are ungrammatical. In linguistics, this approach of using formal systems to mimic the structure of natural languages is known as generative grammar.\n\nBy understanding and applying these principles, computational linguists can develop models that better understand and process natural language, enhancing applications such as natural language processing (NLP) and language modeling.",

The subjects Sasha and Pat, what we might call the breaker of the window breaking event and the opener of the door-opening event, have something in common. They are both volitional actors, often animate, and they have direct causal responsibility for their events. Thematic roles are a way to capture this semantic commonality between breakers and openers. We say that the subjects of both these verbs are agents. Thus, AGENT is the thematic role that represents an abstract idea such as volitional causation. Similarly, the direct objects of both these verbs, the BrokenThing and OpenedThing, are both prototypically inanimate objects that are affected in some way by the action. The semantic role for these participants is theme. [...] Semantic roles thus help generalize over different surface realizations of predicate arguments. For example, while the AGENT is often realized as the subject of the sentence, in other cases the THEME can be the subject. [...] John (AGENT) broke the window (THEME). John (AGENT) broke the window (THEME) with a rock (INSTRUMENT). The rock (INSTRUMENT) broke the window (THEME). The window (THEME) broke. The window (THEME) was broken by John (AGENT). These examples suggest that break has (at least) the possible arguments AGENT, THEME, and INSTRUMENT.

When we discuss events like \"Sasha broke the window\" or \"Pat opened the door,\" we can break these down into roles that each element plays in the action, similar to how you would analyze a function's parameters and their effects.\n\nIn these examples, Sasha and Pat are like \"actors\" in a program. They initiate actions, much like how a function is called to perform a task. In technical terms, these actors are called \"agents.\" An agent is an entity that performs an action intentionally, such as a user triggering a process.\n\nThe objects involved—the window and the door—are the targets of these actions. They are affected by what the agents do, similar to how a data structure might be modified by a function. In linguistic terms, these objects have the role of \"theme.\" A theme is typically an inanimate entity that undergoes some change due to the action.\n\nSometimes, additional elements influence how an action is executed, like a tool or method. For example, \"John broke the window with a rock.\" Here, the rock serves as an \"instrument,\" analogous to a parameter in a function that modifies how the function operates.\n\nThese roles—agent, theme, and instrument—help us understand the dynamics of actions and their effects. Just as in programming, where arguments can change places depending on the function's logic, these roles can shift. For instance, in passive voice constructions, the theme can become the subject: \"The window was broken by John.\"\n\nThis concept of changing roles is similar to verb alternations or diathesis alternations in programming, where the same function can have different signatures or behaviors based on input types or structure.

Let's explore this through the concepts of thematic roles and verb alternations, elements that might be especially relevant to your work with AI and NLP.\n\nConsider the sentences: \"Sasha broke the window\" and \"Pat opened the door.\" Here, Sasha and Pat are the individuals performing actions, known as agents. In linguistics, agents are typically animate and have a conscious intention behind their actions. They have a direct impact on what happens, making them central to these events. The idea of an agent is a thematic role, a tool we use to understand the common characteristics of these subjects, such as their volitional nature and causal influence.\n\nOn the other hand, the window and the door represent the themes in these sentences. Themes are often inanimate objects that undergo a change due to the agent's action. Recognizing these roles helps us identify how different elements in a sentence relate to each other, beyond just their grammatical positions.\n\nThematic roles like agent and theme allow us to generalize across different sentence structures. For example, consider these variations: \"John broke the window with a rock\" and \"The rock broke the window.\" In both, John is the agent, the window is the theme, and the rock serves as the instrument—a means by which the action is carried out. Alternatively, in \"The window was broken by John,\" the theme appears as the subject, showcasing how these roles can shift in sentence structure.\n\nThese shifts in how a verb's arguments are expressed are known as verb alternations or diathesis alternations. For instance, the verb \"break\" can involve an agent, a theme, and sometimes an instrument, depending on how the action is described in a sentence.\n\nUnderstanding these concepts is essential in designing NLP systems that accurately interpret and generate human language, as they allow machines to discern the underlying roles and relationships within sentences.

In this network, there are multiple layers of \"nodes,\" which are like stages in a linguistic analysis.\n\n1. **Input Layer**: Think of this as the initial input of phonemes or words in a sentence. These are simple, individual units of information, similar to the basic sounds or words you start with before analyzing a sentence's deeper meaning.\n\n2. **Hidden Layer**: This layer is akin to the complex syntactic and semantic processes that happen in your mind when you parse a sentence. Just as you transform a string of words into an understood meaning, the hidden layer transforms the input into something more complex. Each \"hidden unit\" is like a syntactic rule or semantic concept, working together to make sense of the input.\n\n3. **Output Layer**: This is the final interpretation or meaning that you derive from a sentence. The output can be a specific classification or decision, much like determining the type of a sentence (declarative, interrogative, etc.) based on its structure and semantics.\n\nThe hidden layer works by applying a set of mathematical ‘rules’ or functions, similar to how linguistic rules are applied to understand sentence structure. In this network, each hidden unit has parameters like weights and biases, which can be compared to linguistic features that influence sentence interpretation, such as intonation or context.\n\nThese parameters are organized into a matrix (like a complex syntactic map), and to process the input, the network performs three main steps:\n\n- **Multiplying** this matrix by the input (imagine applying a syntactic rule across all words in a sentence).\n- **Adding** a bias (similar to considering context or pragmatic information).\n- **Applying an activation function** (like a mental process that decides how strongly certain meanings should be activated, much like semantic priming).\n\nFor example, using the sigmoid function in the network is somewhat like determining whether a sentence is positive or negative based on its overall structure and content. The output from the hidden layer, after these processes, provides a refined interpretation ready for final classification.\n\nThe goal of this network, much like a language analyst, is to take raw input and make informed decisions based on learned patterns, whether it's categorizing text, understanding sentiment, or recognizing linguistic structures.",

You can think of the input layer as the initial set of linguistic features or tokens, such as the vector representations of words from a corpus. These are simple scalar values that the network processes.\n\nThe hidden layer is the core of the neural network, similar to the intermediate steps in a language processing pipeline where deeper linguistic patterns are discerned. Each hidden unit in this layer is akin to a linguistic rule or transformation. The connections between these layers are fully-connected, meaning each unit in a layer receives inputs from all units in the preceding layer, much like every word's context affects its representation in a sentence.\n\nEach hidden unit has parameters: a weight vector and a bias. Think of these as adjustable linguistic rules where the weight vector determines the significance of each input feature, and the bias shifts the entire transformation. For simplicity, we represent these parameters using a weight matrix W and a bias vector b for the whole hidden layer.\n\nThe computations within this hidden layer are efficient, using straightforward matrix operations you're familiar with from computational linguistics. The process involves three steps: multiplying the weight matrix by the input vector (akin to applying a transformation rule), adding the bias vector (adjusting the output), and applying an activation function like sigmoid (σ), tanh, or ReLU, which introduces non-linearity similar to the complexity of language structures. The result is a new representation, h = σ(Wx + b).\n\nFinally, the output layer takes this transformed representation h to produce the final result. This could be a numerical value or, more commonly, a classification decision, such as identifying the sentiment of a sentence or categorizing text into topics. This process is similar to the final step in an NLP task where the goal is to make a classification based on linguistic analysis.",

This loss function assesses how far the student's guess (ˆy) is from the true answer (y), similar to how linguists might measure the accuracy of a semantic interpretation by comparing it to a gold standard. A common choice for this lesson plan in neural networks is the cross-entropy loss, akin to scoring how well a sentence's predicted meaning matches its intended meaning.\n\nTo improve the guesses, the system adjusts its internal parameters, which we can think of as the rules or patterns it uses to derive meanings. This adjustment process is done using a method called gradient descent. It's akin to gradually correcting a student's understanding through feedback, where the feedback is informed by how off the student's guess was.\n\nHowever, in a neural network, there are often many layers of understanding or interpretation—like multiple levels of linguistic analysis from phonetics to semantics. Calculating how much each layer should adjust its rules is tricky because changes in one layer affect others. This is where an algorithm called error backpropagation comes in. It helps determine how to adjust each layer’s parameters by tracing the \"errors\" back through the layers, much like dissecting a sentence to understand where a misunderstanding might have occurred at each level of linguistic analysis.\n\nIn summary, think of a feedforward neural network as a system learning the right meanings from known examples, much like a linguistic student refining their understanding of language structure and meaning through guided examples and feedback.",

Imagine you have a text document, and you treat it like a \"bag of words,\" meaning you focus only on the words themselves and how often they appear, ignoring their order or context, much like counting the frequency of phonemes or morphemes in a linguistic analysis.\n\nThis classifier is termed \"naive\" because of a simplifying assumption: it considers each word's presence as independent of others when determining the overall meaning or category of the document. In linguistics, it's like assuming each word contributes individually to a sentence's meaning without considering syntax or semantics.\n\nNaive Bayes is a type of probabilistic classifier. It decides which category (or class) a document belongs to by calculating which class is most likely, given the words in the document. For instance, if you were categorizing languages based on phonetic patterns, you might assign a language to the category with the most probable phonetic structure.\n\nWe use the term \"ˆc\" to indicate our best guess of the correct category for the document, similar to how you might hypothesize the function of a syntactic structure in a sentence. The classifier uses a mathematical operation called \"argmax,\" which selects the category that maximizes a likelihood function, akin to choosing the most probable interpretation of a linguistic phenomenon.\n\nTo classify a document, naive Bayes calculates two probabilities and multiplies them: the prior probability of a category (how common that category is overall) and the likelihood of the document given that category (how typical the document's words are for that category). This is much like considering both the frequency of a linguistic feature across languages and its occurrence in a specific language.\n\nThe \"bag-of-words\" assumption simplifies the process by ignoring word order, a bit like analyzing a sentence's grammatical role without considering word position. The naive Bayes assumption further simplifies the process by treating word occurrences as independent, similar to assuming phonemes in a language occur independently of one another.\n\nIn conclusion, the naive Bayes classifier, and others like logistic regression, are called linear classifiers because they make decisions based on a straightforward combination of inputs, just as you might combine phonological and syntactic features to categorize languages or dialects.",

This is a type of Bayesian classifier that simplifies the way it views features by assuming they interact independently. Imagine a text document as a \"bag of words,\" meaning we treat it as an unordered collection of words, ignoring their positions and focusing only on how often each word appears.\n\nNaive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier, which means it assigns a document to a class by calculating probabilities. For a document \\(d\\), it predicts the class \\(\\hat{c}\\) that has the highest posterior probability among all possible classes \\(c \\in C\\). Here, the hat symbol (\\(\\hat{}\\)) indicates our estimate of the correct class. The classifier uses the argmax operation to select the class \\(c\\) that maximizes the posterior probability \\(P(c|d)\\), which is expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\hat{c} = \\arg\\max_{c \\in C} P(c|d)\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this by using Bayes' theorem, which changes the formula to:\n\n\\[\n\\hat{c} = \\arg\\max_{c \\in C} P(d|c)P(c)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(P(c)\\) is the prior probability of the class, and \\(P(d|c)\\) is the likelihood of the document given the class. We choose the class with the highest product of these probabilities.\n\nThe \"bag-of-words\" model makes our first assumption: word order doesn't matter. Our second assumption is the naive Bayes assumption, which is the conditional independence assumption. It states that the probabilities of individual features \\(P(f_i|c)\\) are independent given the class \\(c\\), allowing us to multiply them:\n\n\\[\nP(f_1, f_2, \\ldots, f_n|c) = P(f_1|c) \\cdot P(f_2|c) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot P(f_n|c)\n\\]\n\nThus, the naive Bayes classifier selects the class based on:\n\n\\[\nc_{NB} = \\arg\\max_{c \\in C} P(c) \\prod_{f \\in F} P(f|c)\n\\]\n\nNaive Bayes, like logistic regression, is a linear classifier because it uses a linear combination of inputs to make classification decisions.

Much like how the meaning of a word in linguistics is often inferred from its surrounding words, vector semantics defines a word's meaning by looking at the words that frequently appear around it.\n\nImagine each word as a point in a vast, multidimensional space, much like how you might plot phonemes in a formant space to study their acoustic properties. In vector semantics, these points are called \"embeddings.\" These embeddings are constructed based on the distribution of neighboring words, similar to how you might analyze syntax by examining sentence structures.\n\nFor example, consider how \"bank\" can mean a financial institution or the side of a river. The word's meaning is clarified by its neighboring words—\"money\" for the former and \"water\" for the latter. This is the essence of vector semantics: words with similar neighbors tend to have similar meanings.\n\nThere are two main models used for creating these embeddings. \n\n1. **TF-IDF Model**: This approach is like counting the frequency of phonetic features in spoken language. It creates long lists (or vectors) that capture how often words appear near each other. However, these lists often have many zeros, since not all words appear together frequently.\n\n2. **Word2Vec Model**: Think of this as a more refined approach, like creating a concise set of phonetic rules that still capture essential language patterns.

The idea is that if two words frequently appear in similar contexts, they likely have similar meanings.\n\nImagine representing each word as a data point in a high-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a feature derived from the word's context. These data points are what we call \"embeddings.\" You can think of an embedding as a vector that captures the essence of a word based on how it is used in various contexts.\n\nTwo common models for creating these embeddings are tf-idf and word2vec.

This results in long vectors that are often sparse—meaning they have many zero values because most words don't appear together often enough.\n\nOn the other hand, the word2vec model constructs short, dense vectors. These vectors are more efficient and capture meaningful semantic properties, allowing them to be more useful in practical applications like search engines, recommendation systems, and chatbots.\n\nTo draw an analogy from your field, think of embeddings like efficient data structures that represent complex relationships within a dataset.

If these arrows point in the same direction, it means the words are very similar, just as words can be synonyms or have similar meanings (semantics). The cosine measure helps us determine how close these arrows are to each other.\n\nTo calculate this similarity, we use a mathematical tool called the dot product. This is like checking if two words share common features, similar to identifying shared phonetic or semantic properties. When two vectors share high values in the same dimensions, their dot product is high, indicating similarity. Conversely, if their high values are in different dimensions, their dot product is low, showing dissimilarity.\n\nHowever, words that appear often can misleadingly seem similar because their vectors have large values. To correct this, we use a normalized dot product, considering the size of each word's vector.

This involves two main steps: **sampling** and **quantization**. Sampling is akin to taking discrete time samples of a continuous signal, similar to how you might sample data points in a signal processing algorithm. Here, the **sampling rate** is critical; it refers to how many times per second we take these samples. The highest frequency we can capture at a given sampling rate is known as the **Nyquist frequency**.\n\nOnce sampled, the next step is **quantization**. This is like converting floating-point numbers to integers in programming: we map the continuous amplitude values of the sound wave to discrete integer values.\n\nAfter digitizing and quantizing the waveform, we move on to extracting features that represent parts of speech. For this, we divide the audio into small segments called **frames**. Think of frames as overlapping windows over a time series that allow us to analyze the data in chunks.
