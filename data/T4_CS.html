                        <p>A sense (or word sense) is a discrete representation of one aspect of the meaning of a word. [...] In context, it's easy to see the different meanings: mouse1: a mouse controlling a computer system in 1968. mouse2: a quiet animal like a mouse. bank1: a bank can hold the investments in a custodial account. bank2: as agriculture burgeons on the east bank, the river...[...] we need to consider the alternative ways that dictionaries and thesauruses offer for defining senses. One is based on the fact that dictionaries or thesauruses give textual definitions for each sense called glosses. [...] bank: 1. financial institution that accepts deposits and channels the money into lending activities 2. sloping land (especially the slope beside a body of water). [...] when two senses of two different words (lemmas) are identical, or nearly identical, we say the two senses are synonyms [...] couch/sofa vomit/throw up filbert/hazelnut car/automobile. [...] antonyms are words with an opposite meaning, like: long/short big/little fast/slow cold/hot dark/light. [...] [a] hyponym of [a] word if the [other word] is more specific, denoting a subclass of the other. For example, car is a hyponym of vehicle, dog is a hyponym of animal, [...]. Conversely, we say that vehicle is a hypernym of car, and animal is a hypernym of dog. [...] meronymy, the part-whole relation. [...] wheel is a meronym of car, and car is a holonym of wheel.</p>

                    <p>1. In the realm of Computer Science, understanding word senses is crucial. Each sense represents a unique facet of a word's meaning.

    2. For example, consider the words 'mouse' and 'bank'. In the context of programming, 'mouse' refers to the input device that controls a cursor on the screen. 'Bank', on the other hand, can denote a financial institution that manages money transactions.

    3. Dictionaries and thesauruses help define these senses using textual definitions called 'glosses'. For example, the gloss for 'bank' would be something like: "a financial institution that accepts deposits and channels money into lending activities".

    4. When two words share identical or nearly identical meanings, we call them synonyms. For instance, 'couch' and 'sofa' are synonyms, as are 'filbert' and 'hazelnut'.

    5. Conversely, antonyms are words with opposite meanings. For example, 'long' and 'short', 'big' and 'little', 'fast' and 'slow', 'cold' and 'hot', and 'dark' and 'light' are all pairs of antonyms.

    6. A hyponym is a word that is more specific and denotes a subclass of another word. For example, 'car' is a hyponym of 'vehicle', meaning that a car is a type of vehicle.

    7. On the flip side, we call the other word a hypernym. For instance, 'vehicle' is a hypernym of 'car', as it encompasses all types of vehicles, not just cars.

    8. Lastly, meronymy is the relationship between a part and a whole. For example, in a car, the 'wheel' is a part, and the 'car' is the whole. In this case, the car is the holonym of the wheel.</p>

                    <p>In natural language processing, think of **word senses** as different "function overloads" for the same word. Just like `sort()` might handle arrays vs. linked lists differently, the word "mouse" switches meaning based on context:  
- `mouse(context="tech")` → computer device  
- `mouse(context="nature")` → small rodent  

**Synonyms** are like aliases for the same concept—different variable names pointing to the same object (e.g., `couch`/`sofa` or `vomit`/`throw_up`). **Antonyms** are boolean opposites: `dark`/`light` works like `is_dark = !is_light`.  

**Hyponyms** and **hypernyms** mirror class inheritance:  
- `Car` *inherits from* `Vehicle` → "car" is a hyponym of "vehicle"  
- `Vehicle` *is a superclass of* `Car` → "vehicle" is a hypernym of "car"  

**Meronymy** describes object composition:  
- `Wheel` is a component of `Car` → "wheel" is a meronym of "car"  
- `Car` *has-a* `Wheel` → "car" is a holonym of "wheel"  

Dictionaries act like key-value databases, where each sense (key) maps to a definition (value). Disambiguating senses is like resolving variable naming conflicts in a scope—the correct "version" depends on surrounding code (context).</p>
