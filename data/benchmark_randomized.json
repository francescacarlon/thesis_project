Similar to how we parse programming languages, natural language has components that combine hierarchically.\n\nThink of syntactic constituency like object-oriented composition: words group together to form larger functional units (constituents), just as objects combine to create more complex objects. For example, a noun phrase is like a composite class that can contain multiple elements but acts as a single unit in larger structures.\n\nThe CFG implementation for natural language works exactly like the grammars you've used for programming languages:\n- Production rules define valid combinations (similar to BNF notation)\n- A lexicon serves as the terminal symbols (like keywords and literals in programming)\n- Parse trees represent the derivation (identical to AST generation)\n\nFor example, consider this simplified grammar:NP -> ProperNoun | Det Nominal\nDet -> \"a\" | \"the\"\nNoun -> \"flight\"Just as a compiler validates program syntax, these rules determine if a sentence is grammatical (parseable) or ungrammatical (syntax error). The process of generating valid sentences by applying these rules is called generative grammar - conceptually similar to how a programming language grammar generates valid program structures.\n\nThis is why compiler theory and natural language processing share many fundamental algorithms, like recursive descent parsing and CYK parsing, despite operating on different types of languages.",

                    "text": "Syntactic constituents are the fundamental units of organization in language, where groups of words work together to form a single, coherent unit. For instance, a noun phrase (NP) is a sequence of words centered around a noun, such as 'three parties from Brooklyn'. These groups can appear in similar contexts, for example, they can all follow a verb: 'arrive'.\n\n     A common formal system used to analyze and model the structure of these constituents is the Context-Free Grammar (CFG). An CFG consists of a set of rules and a lexicon of words. These rules define the ways that symbols can be grouped and ordered together. For example, an NP can be composed of either a ProperNoun or a Determiner (Det) followed by a Nominal:\n\n    - Det → a, Det → the\n    - Noun → flight\n\n     Rules can be hierarchically nested, allowing for more complex structures. For example, Det → a Det → the.\n\n     By applying these rules in a sequence, we can generate a set of strings, or sentences. This process is called a derivation. A derivation can be represented by a tree structure, with the root at the top.\n\n     An CFG defines a formal language, and sentences that can be derived by a grammar are grammatical sentences. Sentences that cannot be derived by a grammar are ungrammatical.\n\n     The use of formal languages to model natural languages is called generative grammar.",

Sasha and Pat, the instigators of the window-shattering and door-opening incidents, share a commonality. They are active agents who have direct control over their actions. In CS, we label these subjects as agents. The thematic role term for this concept is AGENT. On the other hand, the window and door are passive entities that are subject to change due to the actions of these agents. The semantic role for them is theme.\n\n    2. For example, in the sentences \"John shattered the window\" and \"John shattered the window with a hammer\", the AGENT is John, while the THEME is the broken window, and the hammer acts as the INSTRUMENT in the second sentence. In \"The window shattered\", the window is still the theme, but without an explicit agent. In \"The window was shattered by John\", the agent is John, and the window remains the theme. These examples demonstrate that the verb \"shatter\" can take the arguments AGENT, THEME, and INSTRUMENT.\n\n    3. These diverse argument structures, such as those illustrated in the examples, are known as verb alternations or diathesis alternations. They provide a means to generalize over various forms of predicate arguments. For instance, while the AGENT is often the subject of the sentence, in some cases, the THEME can take on this role.\n\n    By using familiar CS terminology and providing examples that the jury can relate to, the explanation becomes more understandable and accurate.",

One way to think about this is through \"thematic roles,\" which are similar to how we define roles in a function.\n\nConsider two sentences as functions with inputs: \"Sasha broke the window,\" and \"Pat opened the door.\" Here, Sasha and Pat are like the function's main parameters that initiate an action—similar to a main method in a program. These are called AGENTS because they actively cause something to happen, just as a function might execute a series of commands.\n\nThe window and the door represent the objects impacted by these actions, akin to data structures modified by a function. These are labeled as THEMES because they undergo change due to the AGENT's actions.\n\nJust like in programming, where a function can have different input and output configurations, verbs in language can have different argument structures, known as verb alternations. For example:\n\n- \"John broke the window\" involves John as the AGENT and the window as the THEME.\n- \"John broke the window with a rock\" introduces a new role, INSTRUMENT, which is the rock—akin to a tool or helper function in a program.\n- \"The rock broke the window\" shifts the role of the rock to be more prominent, similar to refactoring a program where a helper function becomes the main one.\n- \"The window was broken by John\" reorders roles, like changing the order of operations in a function without altering the final result.\n\nThese thematic roles help us understand how different actions and participants interact, much like analyzing a program's flow and identifying the roles of various components. This concept is useful when designing systems that need to understand language, such as natural language processing tools.",

                    "text": "In the realm of NLP, a sense can be thought of as a unique class or object in a programming context, encapsulating one specific aspect of a word's meaning. Consider the example of a mouse, which can refer to either a computer input device or a small rodent. This duality in meaning is akin to polymorphism in object-oriented programming, where a single entity can have multiple forms or behaviors. Similarly, a bank can be a financial institution or the side of a river, illustrating the concept of method overloading, where a single function or term can have different implementations or meanings based on context. The definitions provided by dictionaries and thesauruses, known as glosses, can be viewed as docstrings or comments in code, offering a human-readable description of each sense. Synonyms, such as couch and sofa, or vomit and throw up, can be seen as equivalent classes or interfaces, where two different words convey the same meaning. Antonyms, like long and short, or big and little, represent opposing values or states, similar to true and false in a boolean context. The relationship between hyponyms and hypernyms can be likened to inheritance in object-oriented programming, where a more specific class (hyponym) inherits properties from a more general class (hypernym). For instance, car is a subclass of vehicle, just as dog is a subclass of animal. Meronymy, the part-whole relation, can be thought of as a composition relationship in programming, where an object is composed of smaller parts, such as a car being composed of wheels, or a wheel being a part of a car. This analogy allows us to better understand the complex relationships between words and their meanings, much like how we design and understand software systems.",

For example, \"mouse\" can refer to:\n       - A computer peripheral used to interact with a system (1968 mouse)\n       - A small rodent (rodent mouse)\n\n    2. \"Bank\" can have the following meanings:\n       - A financial institution that manages and lends money (bank1)\n       - A slope adjacent to a body of water (bank2)\n\n    3. Dictionaries and thesauruses provide alternative definitions for each sense, often in the form of glosses.\n\n    4. Synonyms are two senses of two different words that are identical or nearly identical. For example, couch and sofa are synonyms, as are filbert and hazelnut, car and automobile.\n\n    5. Antonyms are words with opposite meanings, such as long and short, big and little, fast and slow, cold and hot, dark and light.\n\n    6. A hyponym is a more specific word denoting a subclass of another word. For example, car is a hyponym of vehicle, and dog is a hyponym of animal.

Imagine it as a complex language model trying to translate a sentence. For every input sentence (x), we know the correct translation (y) and the model tries to produce its best guess (ŷ) of that translation.\n\nThe goal is to train this model so that its guess (ŷ) is as close as possible to the correct translation (y). To achieve this, it adjusts certain internal elements (let's call them parameters, similar to phonetic rules in a language) over several layers, each layer refining the guess based on the previous one.\n\nFirst, we need a way to measure the difference between the model's guess and the correct translation, much like evaluating how well a student has translated a sentence. We use a method called cross-entropy loss for this purpose, which is similar to assessing the semantic accuracy in translation.\n\nNext, to minimize this difference, we use an optimization technique called gradient descent. This is akin to gradually fine-tuning a grammar rule by observing many instances of its application.\n\nHowever, this process involves many parameters, like adjusting various phonetic and syntactic rules simultaneously, which can become complex in a large system. To effectively adjust these, we use a technique called error backpropagation. It's like retracing steps in a derivational tree to see how a change at one point affects the overall structure.\n\nIn essence, error backpropagation helps us understand how to tweak the phonetic and syntactic rules at various layers to improve the overall translation accuracy of the neural network.",

This process, known as backward differentiation, leverages the chain rule for composite functions.\n\n    2. To illustrate, consider a multi-layered function f(x) = u(v(w(x))). The derivative of f(x) can be broken down into three components: the derivative of u(x) with respect to v(x), the derivative of v(x) with respect to w(x), and the derivative of w(x) with respect to x.\n\n    3. The chain rule, applied here, links the derivatives of each function to the derivative of the overall function. If we have a more complex function with multiple layers, the same rule applies. For instance, a function like f(x) = u(v(w(x))) would follow the formula: df/dx = du/dv·dv/dw·dw/dx.\n\n    4. The essence of backward differentiation is to propagate gradients from the final node back through all nodes in the graph.

One key concept is the \"computation graph,\" which is like a detailed map that shows how different parts of a system are connected and interact. This map is important because it helps us figure out how to make the system better at its tasks, similar to how we might refine our understanding of a language.\n\nImagine you're analyzing a sentence's structure to understand its meaning—a process linguists are familiar with. In AI, we use a method called \"backward differentiation\" to enhance our models. Think of it like tracing a sentence back from its conclusion to see how each word contributes to the overall meaning.\n\nIn backward differentiation, we use a mathematical tool called the \"chain rule.\" It's like understanding how a complex sentence breaks down into smaller parts. For instance, if you have a function f(x) that's made of two smaller functions, say u(v(x)), the chain rule helps us understand how changes in x affect the entire sentence through these smaller components.\n\nIf we add more layers, like u(v(w(x))), the chain rule still applies, allowing us to trace the influence of the smallest component (x) on the overall result (f(x)). This is similar to breaking down a complex sentence into even smaller grammatical units.\n\nNow, let's talk about how this works in practice. Each \"node\" in the computation graph (think of nodes as words or phrases in a sentence) takes a \"gradient\" (similar to how a word influences meaning) from its \"parent node\" (what comes later in the sentence) and calculates how it affects the input. This process continues backward through the graph, much like how you'd parse a sentence from end to beginning to understand its structure.\n\nFor example, if we represent a concept L as the product of c and e (L = ce), finding how L changes with respect to c is straightforward, like identifying the role of a word in a sentence. But for more complex relationships, such as understanding how L changes with respect to a or b, we rely on the chain rule to trace these relationships back through the graph, much like unpacking the layers of meaning in a complex sentence.\n\nIn summary, computation graphs and backward differentiation in AI are akin to breaking down and understanding language structures in linguistics. Both involve tracing back through components to see how each part contributes to the whole.",

                    "text": "Language model enthusiasts often face challenges when training Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to handle tasks that require a network to take into account information far removed from the current processing point. The information stored in hidden states tends to be more relevant to the latest parts of the input sequence and recent decisions, with crucial details from prior sections often getting lost along the way. This is known as the vanishing gradients problem.\n\n     To overcome these issues, experts have developed more intricate network designs to manage the task of maintaining context over time, helping the network to discard irrelevant information and remember crucial data for impending decisions. A popular extension to RNNs is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.\n\n     LSTMs are designed to manage context by discarding unnecessary information and holding on to useful data for future decision-making. They achieve this by adding an explicit context layer to the network architecture and carefully controlling the flow of information into and out of the units. This is done through the use of specialized gates.\n\n     The forget gate's primary function is to erase information from the context that is no longer relevant. The add gate serves to select the data to include in the current context. The output gate determines which information is essential for the current hidden state.",

                    "text": "Consider a sentence where you want to understand the relationship between words that are far apart, like \"The dog, which ran quickly, caught the ball.\" To comprehend this sentence, you need to keep track of the subject \"dog\" and its actions across the sentence. In linguistic terms, this is similar to analyzing long-distance dependencies in syntax. \n\n    In a similar way, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) process sequential data, like sentences, one step at a time. However, they struggle to retain information from earlier parts of the sequence, much like how it's hard to remember the beginning of a long sentence. This is because the information encoded in the hidden states of RNNs is local, focusing on the most recent parts of the input sequence and recent decisions. As a result, the gradients, which are essential for training the network, tend to disappear, a phenomenon known as the vanishing gradients problem.\n\n    To overcome this issue, more complex network architectures, like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have been developed. LSTMs are designed to manage context over time, allowing the network to learn what information to discard and what to retain for future decisions. This is analogous to a linguistic process where you selectively focus on specific words or phrases in a sentence to understand its meaning.\n\n    LSTMs achieve this by introducing an explicit context layer and control gates that regulate the flow of information. These gates operate sequentially, using additional weights to determine what information to add, remove, or output. The forget gate acts like a filter, removing irrelevant information from the context, while the add gate selects relevant information to include. The output gate then decides what information is necessary for the current hidden state, much like how you choose the relevant words to focus on when parsing a sentence.\n\n    By using LSTMs, the network can effectively handle long-distance dependencies in sequential data, much like how linguists analyze complex sentence structures. This enables the network to make more accurate predictions and decisions, making it a powerful tool for natural language processing tasks. \n\n    Think of LSTMs as a skilled reader who can keep track of the narrative thread, retaining relevant information and discarding unnecessary details, to ultimately comprehend the meaning of a text. This ability to manage context and selectively focus on relevant information makes LSTMs a valuable asset in understanding and generating human language.",
