                        <p>1. To assess the similarity between words v and w, we require a metric that computes the angle between their vector representations. This metric, primarily, is the cosine of the angle between the vectors. The cosine function, similar to many NLP vector similarity measures, is grounded in the dot product operation from linear algebra, also known as the inner product. The dot product serves as a similarity measure because it tends to be high when the vectors have substantial values in the same dimensions. In contrast, vectors with zeros in different dimensions, or orthogonal vectors, have a dot product of 0, signifying their strong difference. The raw dot product will be greater for frequent words. However, we aim for a similarity metric that reveals the similarity of words disregarding their frequency. To achieve this, we resort to the normalized dot product, a · b / |a||b| = cosθ.</p>

                        <p>In natural language processing (NLP), measuring the similarity between two words, v and w, can be thought of as a clustering problem where we want to group similar words together. To achieve this, we need a metric that can compare two vectors representing these words. The most commonly used metric is the cosine similarity, which calculates the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. This metric is based on the dot product operator, which you're familiar with from linear algebra. The dot product of two vectors, a and b, is given by the sum of the products of their corresponding components. Think of it like the weighted sum of the similarities between each dimension of the two vectors. 

    For instance, if we have two vectors a = [1, 2, 3] and b = [4, 5, 6], the dot product a · b would be (1*4) + (2*5) + (3*6) = 4 + 10 + 18 = 32. This operation can be seen as a way to measure how similar two vectors are, as it will result in higher values when the vectors have large values in the same dimensions. 

    However, the raw dot product has a limitation - it's biased towards frequent words. To address this, we use the normalized dot product, also known as cosine similarity, which is given by a · b / |a| |b|. This formula is equivalent to cosθ, where θ is the angle between the two vectors. By normalizing the dot product, we can compare the similarity between words regardless of their frequency. 

    To illustrate this, consider two vectors a and b, where a = [1, 0, 0] and b = [0, 1, 0]. In this case, the dot product a · b would be 0, indicating that the vectors are orthogonal and thus dissimilar. On the other hand, if we have two vectors c = [1, 1, 1] and d = [1, 1, 1], the dot product c · d would be 3, and the cosine similarity would be 1, indicating that the vectors are identical. 

    This concept is analogous to the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm in machine learning, where we find the most similar data points to a given input. In NLP, we're essentially doing the same thing - finding the most similar words to a given word based on their vector representations. By using cosine similarity, we can effectively capture the semantic meaning of words and group similar words together, which is crucial in many NLP applications such as text classification, clustering, and information retrieval. 

    In summary, the cosine similarity metric is a powerful tool in NLP that allows us to compare the similarity between two words based on their vector representations. By normalizing the dot product, we can overcome the limitation of frequent words and capture the semantic meaning of words, enabling us to build more accurate and effective NLP models.</p>

                        <p>To determine how similar two words are, we can represent each word as a vector and then use a mathematical method to compare these vectors. One common way to do this is by calculating the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. This approach is based on the dot product, a concept from linear algebra that you may be familiar with from machine learning when dealing with data representations.

The dot product is useful for measuring similarity because it is large when two vectors align closely, meaning they have similar features or characteristics. Conversely, if the vectors are orthogonal, or in other words, unrelated (having zeros in matching positions), their dot product will be zero, indicating no similarity.

However, the raw dot product can be influenced by the frequency of the words, as frequent words tend to have larger vector values, which could artificially inflate similarity measurements. To address this, we use the normalized dot product, which divides the dot product by the magnitudes of the vectors. This normalization gives us the cosine similarity, a value between -1 and 1, that indicates how similar two vectors are, independent of their length or frequency. It is akin to normalizing data to ensure fair comparison, a technique often used in data preprocessing.</p>

                        <p>Here's how word similarity works in computational linguistics, explained through a CS lens:

Think of words as vectors in a high-dimensional space, similar to feature vectors in machine learning. To compare two words (let's call them v and w), we need a similarity function that operates on their vector representations.

The most popular similarity metric is cosine similarity - a concept you might recognize from recommender systems or clustering algorithms. It's derived from the dot product operation, which you've likely encountered in linear algebra or neural network computations.

The dot product works well as a similarity metric because it essentially performs element-wise multiplication and summation. Just like in sparse matrix operations, when two vectors have non-zero values in matching dimensions, they contribute to higher similarity. When vectors have non-zero values in different dimensions (orthogonal vectors, like perpendicular arrays), their dot product becomes 0, indicating no similarity.

However, raw dot product has a limitation: frequently occurring words will naturally have larger vector magnitudes, skewing the results (similar to how common features can dominate in unscaled machine learning models). To normalize for frequency, we divide the dot product by the vectors' magnitudes, giving us the cosine formula: cos(θ) = (a·b)/(|a||b|). This normalization is analogous to feature scaling in machine learning preprocessing.</p>

                        <p>To compare word vectors (like embeddings in ML), think of cosine similarity as a normalized dot product that ignores vector magnitude—focusing only on directional alignment. Here's the CS breakdown:  

1. **Dot Product Baseline**: Like element-wise multiplication summed across dimensions (e.g., `np.dot(v, w)`), it highlights shared high-value features. But it’s biased toward frequent words (larger magnitudes).  

2. **Normalization Fix**: Just as you’d normalize data for SVM/k-means, divide the dot product by the product of vector magnitudes (`||v|| * ||w||`). This scales vectors to unit length, isolating their *direction* in the high-dimensional space.  

3. **Angle as Similarity**: The result (`cosθ`) measures the angle between vectors. θ=0° (cos=1): identical direction (e.g., "king" vs "monarch"). θ=90° (cos=0): orthogonal, no feature overlap (e.g., "database" vs "poetry").  

**Why CS folks care**: It’s feature-space alignment without frequency noise—like checking if two codebases have similar architecture patterns, regardless of total lines. Used in clustering, retrieval, or analogy tasks (`word2vec`'s king - man + woman ≈ queen).</p>
